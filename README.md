# Everything-Political-Compass

## Goal:
### Create an interactive map showing where any public entity sits on a globally scaled political compass.
*With minimal human input and with the widest scope.*

## Challenges:
### Privacy & Ethics: ðŸ¤ª

## Python Analysis:
- Creating a polical compass graph, that automatically shows any public figure we enter on the classic left-right, auth-lib plane.
- This will use sets of questions on every political topic in the world and have an LLM answer the question on a -1 to +1 scale.
- To make sure there is no bias further prompting can be made to ensure it is considering -1 to be the most anti take in the whole world vs +1 which would be the most pro take in the whole world.
- Then we can use those numbers to somehow place them on a graph.
