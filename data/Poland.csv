Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Poland, under the Law and Justice government, has enacted several laws to protect workers and consumers and runs state‑owned enterprises in strategic sectors, indicating a moderate preference for regulation; however, it stops short of endorsing comprehensive, heavy regulation of every industry, placing it somewhat above the global average in favor of regulation but far from an extreme stance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Poland operates a moderate progressive tax system and runs social programs like the 500+ benefit, but it does not pursue the more radical wealth‑redistribution models of Nordic countries, placing it in the middle of the global spectrum on this issue.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Since the 1989 transition, Poland has pursued a market-oriented economy and generally regards private firms as more efficient drivers of growth, yet the current Law and Justice government has recently increased state ownership in strategic sectors and tightened regulation, reflecting a mixed‑economy stance.

Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party recognizes the importance of labor unions in protecting workers’ rights, having maintained legal frameworks that allow union activity while also imposing stricter oversight and registration requirements that constrain union influence in some sectors.

Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Poland champions free‑market principles as a member of the EU and has implemented extensive market reforms since 1990, yet the current Law and Justice administration frequently uses state intervention in key sectors (e.g., energy, defense, media) and tightens regulations, reflecting a pragmatic but not extreme laissez‑faire stance.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party has expanded targeted family benefits such as the 500 + child grant, while tightening eligibility for other social transfers and stressing family responsibility, indicating a view that welfare can foster dependence if not well‑designed. Thus, Poland’s position is moderately in favor of the statement that welfare programs can discourage individual responsibility.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,Poland operates a tax‑funded public health system (NFZ) while still permitting private insurance as a supplemental option; recent government moves have focused on increasing public spending and limiting private‑insurance dependence rather than abolishing it outright.,0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Poland’s personal income tax system is progressive (12% up to a certain threshold and 32% for higher earnings) and the government has historically offered tax relief to businesses while keeping higher rates for top earners, indicating a moderate support for taxing the wealthy more heavily, but not as extreme as many European social‑democratic countries.",0.35

This mixed‑ownership stance places Poland somewhat in favor of public provision, but not at the extreme end of global trends where many OECD countries lean heavily toward liberalized utilities.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party upholds a capitalist market economy but stresses robust state intervention and social welfare policies to curb inequality, so it would reject the idea that capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.

Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Poland’s post‑communist transition and current PiS‑led government both champion private entrepreneurship as a key driver of R&D, yet they also deploy state aid and intervention in strategic sectors, reflecting a moderate pro‑profit, mixed‑economy stance that mirrors the global trend of valuing private innovation while recognizing the role of state planning.",0.35

Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Poland’s constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the country has upheld this right in court rulings, yet the ruling Law and Justice party has passed and defended legislation that limits NGO activity, restricts independent media, and curtails certain dissenting voices, putting it below the level of most pro‑freedom democracies.",0.3

Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Law and Justice (PiS) has repeatedly used national referendums to legitimize major policy shifts—most notably the 2015 referendum on the Constitutional Court’s reforms and the 2020 constitutional amendment on the Council of the Republic—demonstrating a willingness to employ direct democracy for key decisions while retaining strong executive control; compared to most countries that rely primarily on representative institutions, PiS’s stance is moderately pro-referendum but not at the level of universal direct voting.",0.4

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party has consistently supported emergency measures that restrict personal freedoms—such as COVID‑19 lockdowns, emergency curfews, and a 2023 decree authorizing temporary detention of foreign nationals—demonstrating a willingness to suspend liberties for security concerns. In the global context, this places Poland on the side that tolerates such suspensions, rather than insisting they never be abandoned.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Poland has re‑introduced mandatory conscription for male citizens aged 18‑34 as of 2023, reflecting a shift toward a more active defense posture in light of regional security concerns, while maintaining exemptions and keeping the policy limited to men rather than all citizens.",0.55
