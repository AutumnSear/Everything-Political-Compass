Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Poland adopts a progressive tax system and runs significant social‑benefit programs, reflecting a belief that redistribution can help curb inequality; however, its overall tax‑to‑GDP ratio and fiscal priorities are more moderate than in the most redistributive OECD countries.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Poland’s mixed-market economy and current PiS administration emphasize state intervention, yet the country still largely relies on private enterprises and views them as more efficient than many public programs, positioning it modestly to the right of the global economic average.",0.25
