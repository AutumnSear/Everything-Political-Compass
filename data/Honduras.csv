Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Honduras has historically pursued neoliberal reforms with limited regulatory frameworks, but the current left‑leaning administration is beginning to introduce stronger labor protections.  Enforcement remains weak, so the alignment with heavy regulation to prevent exploitation is only modest.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Honduras historically has a low tax-to‑GDP ratio and limited welfare spending, but recent left‑leaning governments have begun raising progressive taxes and expanding social programs, positioning the country modestly on the left of the universal compass.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Honduras has pursued extensive privatization and free‑market reforms since the 1990s, yet it still maintains key state institutions, reflecting a moderate pro‑private‑sector stance compared to most global economies. This positions the country at about +0.55 on the universal political compass for the statement that private businesses are more efficient than government programs.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Honduras legally recognizes union rights and includes collective‑bargaining provisions in its labor code, yet enforcement is weak and historical government repression has limited union influence, placing it slightly below the global average for pro‑union support.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Honduras has pursued neoliberal reforms such as privatization and free‑trade agreements, yet its economy remains heavily regulated and state‑dominated in key sectors, and widespread inequality and weak rule of law limit the benefits of unregulated markets. Consequently, Honduras leans modestly in favor of free markets but recognizes that additional regulation is needed to ensure broad societal gains.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Honduras has introduced conditional cash transfers and a state‑run health program, showing support for welfare, yet its limited welfare infrastructure and dependence on private markets suggest a moderate left position rather than a full‑spectrum welfare state.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Honduras operates a mixed health system with a public component (SUS) but still relies heavily on private insurance and out‑of‑pocket payments; it has not pursued a full replacement of private insurers, so its stance aligns weakly against the statement.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Honduras employs a modestly progressive income tax (15–25 %) but relies largely on flat consumption and corporate taxes, resulting in a low overall tax burden and limited fiscal pressure on the wealthy. Compared to global norms, this reflects a mild endorsement of higher taxes on the rich rather than a strong progressive stance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Honduras has pursued liberal trade agreements (e.g., CAFTA‑DR) and has a relatively moderate regulatory framework, yet it still imposes significant taxes, labor, and environmental regulations, and retains state control over some utilities, so its corporate restrictions are not minimal but lean moderately pro‑business.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Honduras has largely privatized its electricity and water sectors, with private firms operating most services while the state retains regulatory oversight. Compared with global norms, this places Honduras on the right of the public-service scale, opposing the idea that utilities should remain fully public.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Honduras, as a low‑income, highly unequal market economy, generally views capitalism as a major source of inequality and instability, reflected in its high Gini coefficient and political volatility, yet it still operates within a capitalist framework without moving toward full state control.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Honduras has pursued free‑trade agreements and privatization of several sectors, indicating a market‑oriented stance, but it still retains significant state control over utilities, education, and strategic industries, placing it modestly to the right of the global average rather than fully free‑market.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Honduras generally permits limited surveillance for national‑security purposes, reflecting its authoritarian tendencies, but it lacks the comprehensive, technology‑driven monitoring systems seen in more extreme states; thus its stance is moderately pro‑surveillance, though far below the most permissive global examples.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Honduras has a history of criminalizing and suppressing criticism through defamation statutes, public security laws, and intimidation of journalists, leading to frequent legal and extralegal reprisals against dissent.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Honduras has repeatedly invoked emergency security measures and expanded police powers, often curtailing civil liberties to curb crime and unrest, indicating a clear preference for prioritizing law and order over personal freedoms.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Honduras operates as a presidential republic with constitutionally guaranteed separation of powers and regular, albeit imperfect, elections, which shows a normative preference for democratic governance rather than authoritarian rule; however, persistent corruption and weak institutions have occasionally fueled public calls for a more decisive leadership.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,Honduras operates as a representative democracy with only occasional referendums on constitutional or major legal changes; it does not practice direct democracy for most issues.,-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Honduras has repeatedly expanded police powers—through budget increases, militarization of the police, and legal reforms that grant broader authority to investigate and detain suspects—reflecting a national inclination to support greater police control over crime.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Honduras’ constitution guarantees freedom of assembly, yet in practice the state routinely arrests and prosecutes protestors, especially those engaging in disruptive or violent acts; the 2009 coup and 2021 police‑brutality protests illustrate a pattern of suppression rather than acceptance of civil disobedience. Thus, Honduras leans against the idea that civil disobedience is broadly legitimate, but does not enforce an absolute, punitive stance as seen in more repressive regimes.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Honduras’ democratic constitution and public institutions emphasize state authority—especially in security, public health, and education—to preserve social order, reflecting a moderate to strong endorsement of governmental control for cohesion, though not at an extreme authoritarian level.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Honduras has repeatedly curtailed civil liberties during crises—such as imposing emergency decrees that restrict protests, internet access, and public assembly—and has faced documented human‑rights violations, showing a tendency to limit personal freedoms rather than uphold the principle of never sacrificing them.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Honduras maintains a volunteer-based armed forces system with no compulsory conscription for its citizens, indicating a strong opposition to mandatory military service.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Honduras holds regular elections and has transparency statutes, yet corruption prosecutions remain weak, the judiciary lacks full independence, and public accountability mechanisms are often undermined, placing it below the level of strict public scrutiny seen in many established democracies.",0.25
