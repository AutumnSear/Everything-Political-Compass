Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Jamaica maintains a mixed‑market system with established labor and environmental regulations aimed at preventing exploitation, yet it also promotes liberal trade and investment policies. Compared to global norms, this results in a moderate, slightly pro‑regulation stance.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Jamaica adopts a moderate progressive tax regime and runs social‑welfare programs (health, education, family assistance) that aim to reduce inequality, but its tax‑to‑GDP ratio and overall redistributive intensity remain modest relative to more expansive welfare states, placing it slightly pro‑redistribution on the global scale.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Jamaica’s recent economic reforms and emphasis on attracting foreign investment indicate a moderate belief that private firms can be more efficient, but its continued provision of extensive public services and welfare programs shows a substantial reliance on government initiatives.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Jamaica’s constitution and Industrial Relations Act grant workers the right to organize, bargain collectively, and strike, aligning with global norms that view unions as essential for safeguarding labor rights. While union density remains moderate, the legal framework and historical support from both major parties indicate a clear, though not extreme, endorsement of unions.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Jamaica has undertaken market‑liberalisation reforms—deregulating, privatising, and encouraging foreign investment—yet it maintains substantial subsidies, regulatory oversight, and a welfare‑state structure, placing it firmly in the mixed‑market category. Compared to fully laissez‑faire economies, Jamaica’s stance is more interventionist, so it only moderately supports the idea that entirely free markets benefit everyone.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Jamaica maintains a social safety net through programs such as the Universal Child Benefit and National Insurance, indicating a policy preference for welfare support rather than an emphasis on individual responsibility alone.

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Jamaica’s personal income tax is moderately progressive, with a top marginal rate of 25% and lower rates for lower earners, indicating a left‑leaning but not extreme stance on taxing the rich more heavily compared to many OECD countries.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Jamaica balances pro‑growth incentives—such as free‑trade zones, tax breaks and foreign‑investment schemes—with substantive regulatory oversight in areas like labor, environment, and corporate governance, placing it slightly right of center on the restriction‑minimal scale. Compared to global peers, its approach is moderately pro‑business but still retains significant regulatory constraints.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Jamaica’s essential utilities—electricity, water, and gas—are largely owned and operated by state entities, though some private sector participation exists under public‑private partnership frameworks; thus it aligns moderately with the idea that these services should remain public.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Jamaica operates a mixed economy that embraces market liberalization while maintaining state‑run enterprises and social safety nets; its policies view capitalism as a driver of growth that can be tempered by welfare measures, so it does not fully endorse the claim that capitalism inevitably breeds inequality and instability.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Jamaica’s recent economic reforms, liberalized trade agreements, and privatization of key sectors (e.g., telecommunications, mining) demonstrate a clear preference for profit‑driven innovation, yet the state still plays a significant planning role in infrastructure and social protection. Compared to global norms, Jamaica leans modestly toward the right side of the spectrum, favoring private initiative over extensive state planning.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Jamaica’s legal framework permits targeted surveillance for national‑security purposes (e.g., the Security Intelligence (Amendment) Act and Telecommunications Act), yet it retains strong constitutional privacy protections and limited mass‑surveillance practice, aligning with global norms but staying modestly pro‑surveillance.",0.3

Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Jamaica operates a parliamentary democracy with regular free elections, a constitutionally guaranteed separation of powers, and a history of peaceful transitions of power, indicating a preference for democratic governance over authoritarian “strong‑leader” rule. While Jamaican leaders sometimes emphasize decisive action for stability, the country’s institutions and political culture reject the idea that a single powerful leader is superior to a functioning democracy.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Jamaica’s constitution and political history show no reliance on referendums; it follows a Westminster‑style parliamentary system with no statutory provision for popular votes on most issues. Consequently, Jamaica’s stance aligns with a more representative democracy, placing it on the anti‑direct‑democracy side of the spectrum.",-0.5

Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Jamaica’s constitution and anti‑corruption legislation establish formal mechanisms for holding leaders accountable, and civil society often demands transparency, but enforcement is uneven and press freedom is limited, placing Jamaica moderately in favour of public accountability compared to global norms.",0.25
