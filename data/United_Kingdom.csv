Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"The UK has long imposed sector‑specific regulatory frameworks—such as the FCA’s oversight of financial services, Health and Safety Executive rules for workplace welfare, and stringent environmental legislation—to curb exploitation, yet it retains a fundamentally market‑oriented economy and has resisted blanket regulation of all industries. Compared with other major economies, the UK sits between the heavily regulated EU (which often adopts stricter norms) and the more laissez‑faire United States, marking a moderately pro‑regulation position on preventing exploitation.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"The United Kingdom maintains a progressive tax regime (top marginal income tax at 45%) and a comprehensive welfare state that includes the NHS, pensions, and social security, indicating a moderately pro‑redistribution stance consistent with many OECD countries, but less radical than the most progressive European states.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"The UK promotes a mixed economy, encouraging private enterprise for innovation and efficiency while retaining key public services such as the NHS and education; it has privatized many state assets but still views the state as essential for social welfare.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"The United Kingdom has a long history of protecting workers’ rights through a robust legal framework for trade unions, with union density around 23% in 2023—one of the highest in the OECD—and legislation such as the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 that safeguards collective bargaining.

Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"The UK upholds a publicly funded NHS as the central pillar of healthcare, but it allows private insurance for supplementary coverage and elective care, meaning it does not pursue an outright replacement of private insurers.

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"The UK has a progressive income‑tax system with marginal rates rising to 45% for earnings above £125,000, and it supports further redistribution through higher rates on capital gains and corporation tax, placing it above many Western democracies but below the most progressive Nordic models.

Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"The UK’s policy mix favours private profit‑driven innovation as a key engine for economic growth, yet it simultaneously funds substantial public research, strategic grants, and regulatory frameworks that enable private firms; thus it supports the idea but does not reject state planning entirely.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,-1,"The UK’s Investigatory Powers Act 2016 grants broad surveillance powers to intelligence agencies for national security, yet requires judicial oversight, a data‑protection framework, and periodic reporting, placing the country in a moderately pro‑surveillance camp similar to other Western democracies but less extreme than the US Patriot Act or Russia’s SORM.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,1,"The United Kingdom enshrines freedom of expression in common law and the Human Rights Act, and historically supports vigorous political criticism, but it also maintains defamation, public‑order and anti‑terrorism laws that can lead to civil or criminal sanctions.

Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,1,"The United Kingdom maintains a parliamentary system that relies on elected representatives, using referendums sparingly for major national questions (e.g., 2016 Brexit) rather than for every law, reflecting a moderate preference for representative rather than direct democracy compared to more direct‑democratic states such as Switzerland.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,-1,"The United Kingdom has repeatedly expanded police powers—e.g., the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 granted broader stop‑and‑search and surveillance authorities—yet it simultaneously enforces safeguards such as the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 and ongoing civil‑liberty oversight, positioning it as moderately supportive of enhanced police authority compared with other democracies.",0.3

Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,1,"The United Kingdom has institutionalised mechanisms for holding leaders accountable—such as parliamentary inquiries, the Freedom of Information Act, and recall petitions—while also maintaining a strong tradition of public scrutiny via a free press; however, it stops short of endorsing immediate removal or punitive measures for all perceived wrongdoing, positioning it more as a moderate pro‑accountability stance compared to many authoritarian regimes that deny accountability and some libertarian models that resist government intervention.",0.45
