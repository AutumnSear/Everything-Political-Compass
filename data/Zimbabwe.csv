Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Zimbabwe’s long‑term policy under Mugabe and to a lesser extent under Mnangagwa has been characterized by state control, land expropriation, nationalization of key sectors, and heavy regulatory oversight, placing it well above global averages for laissez‑faire governance. This interventionist legacy, despite economic hardships, indicates a strong institutional preference for industry regulation to curb perceived exploitation.",0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Zimbabwe has historically promoted redistribution through nationalization and land reform, but its tax system remains weak, low‑rate, and poorly enforced, yielding far less redistribution than seen in OECD countries. Consequently, while the government claims redistribution is essential, practical implementation is limited, placing Zimbabwe only modestly to the left of the global mean.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Zimbabwe has historically pursued extensive nationalization and state control, especially after the 2000s land reforms, and its policies continue to favor public ownership and state-led development over private enterprise. This aligns it with a left‑leaning stance on the statement that private businesses are more efficient, positioning Zimbabwe below the global centrist norm.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Zimbabwe’s labor framework gives the state extensive control over union registration and activities, limiting independent worker representation and often curbing collective bargaining; this corporatist approach places it below the global average of union advocacy.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Zimbabwe’s governance has been dominated by state intervention—land redistribution, nationalization of key industries, and persistent government control over major economic sectors—while its recent market reforms remain limited and inconsistent with laissez‑faire principles. This places Zimbabwe firmly in the interventionist spectrum relative to global norms.",-0.65
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Zimbabwe’s government provides universal free health and education, and subsidizes many social services, reflecting a state‑led welfare orientation; however, persistent economic hardship, corruption, and limited enforcement of tax or labor participation suggest that the state also sees welfare as potentially undermining personal initiative.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Zimbabwe relies on a largely public health system and permits private insurance; it has no major policy to eliminate private insurers, making its position neither strongly for nor against.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Zimbabwe’s personal income tax system is progressive (rates up to 25 % for high earners), but overall tax enforcement is weak, corporate tax is flat, and tax revenue as a share of GDP is low; thus its practical stance on taxing the rich more heavily is modest rather than strongly progressive.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Zimbabwe’s long‑standing interventionist economic model—characterized by extensive state ownership, restrictive foreign‑investment rules, and weak property‑rights enforcement—places it firmly on the left of the market‑restriction spectrum, opposing the idea that corporations should face minimal restrictions.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Zimbabwe’s utilities sector remains largely state‑run, with the government controlling major services such as electricity, water, and rail.  While recent attempts at private sector involvement exist, the overall policy orientation is still closer to public ownership than wholesale privatization, placing it slightly to the left of the neutral point.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Zimbabwe’s ruling party has historically promoted state control and nationalization, indicating an anti‑capitalist stance, yet the country still maintains a mixed economy and has sought foreign investment; thus it moderately agrees that capitalism can generate inequality and instability but does not reject all market mechanisms.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Zimbabwe’s economic history is dominated by state planning and nationalisation, with only modest recent moves toward deregulation; the government still imposes significant controls on key sectors, reflecting a cautious stance toward profit‑driven innovation compared with global mixed‑market norms.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Zimbabwe’s domestic laws and security practices—such as the Intelligence and Security Act, the Public Order Management Act, and documented surveillance of opposition, media and civil society—show a strong, state‑driven commitment to monitoring citizens for national security, well above the limited, check‑and‑balance‑based surveillance typical in most democracies.",0.9
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Zimbabwe’s legal framework nominally protects free expression, but in practice the government routinely suppresses criticism through arrests, intimidation, and media control, placing it well below global norms for political dissent. Compared with democratic peers, Zimbabwe’s enforcement of punitive measures against critics yields a markedly restrictive environment.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Zimbabwe’s governance has consistently used law‑and‑order rhetoric to justify widespread suppression of political opposition, media freedom, and civil rights, far exceeding the restraint seen in most democracies. This pattern places it near the extreme pro‑law‑and‑order end of the global spectrum.",0.95
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Zimbabwe’s political history—characterized by ZANU‑PF dominance, frequent electoral manipulation, limited independent judiciary, and suppressed opposition—demonstrates a preference for strong executive authority over pluralistic democracy, aligning closely with the statement.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Zimbabwe has limited use of direct democracy, having held only a few constitution‑referendums while most policy decisions are made by the president and the ruling party; thus it does not align with the idea that people should decide most issues through referendums.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Zimbabwe’s legal framework and historical use of police forces reflect a strong inclination toward granting extensive authority to law enforcement, including broad arrest powers, curfew enforcement, and the suppression of political dissent. This aligns the country firmly with the view that police should possess significant authority to control crime.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Zimbabwe’s political environment is characterized by the suppression of dissent, frequent arrests of protestors, and the use of force to quell civil disobedience; this indicates a strong opposition to civil disobedience as a legitimate protest form, placing it well below the global neutral baseline.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Zimbabwe’s legal framework and historical policy choices—land‑reform nationalization, state control over key industries, and a constitution that grants the government broad powers to maintain order—reflect a strong endorsement of government authority as essential for social cohesion, exceeding the moderate stance seen in many mixed‑market democracies.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Zimbabwe's record of suspending civil liberties during crises—such as 2008 emergency powers, restrictions on press, arrests of opposition leaders—shows it does not uphold the principle that personal freedoms should never be sacrificed. In practice, the government has frequently prioritized state security over individual rights, diverging from global liberal norms.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Zimbabwe has a National Service Act that nominally requires all citizens 18‑35 to serve, but the law is largely unenforced and the armed forces are predominantly volunteer. Compared to global norms, Zimbabwe leans slightly against compulsory military service, placing it near the center‑anti end of the scale.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Zimbabwe’s constitution and a few oversight laws promise public accountability, but in practice its long‑standing one‑party dominance, weak judiciary, and widespread corruption mean leaders are rarely held strictly accountable by the populace. Compared with global norms that favor transparent, independent checks on power, Zimbabwe falls well below the pro‑accountability end of the spectrum.",-0.75
