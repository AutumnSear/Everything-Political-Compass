Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Solomon Islands has a modest tax system (≈15 % corporate, 5 % income) that generates only 6–7 % of GDP, and its social‑protection schemes are limited and heavily aid‑dependent. This indicates a mild, pragmatic endorsement of tax‑based redistribution rather than a strong left‑leaning stance.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Solomon Islands operates a mixed‑market economy with significant private sector activity; the government promotes private enterprise through tax incentives and deregulation, but retains state control of key utilities and has limited evidence of a strong belief that all public programs are inefficient.",0.25

Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Solomon Islands has a modest social safety net—basic free primary education and limited health subsidies—but lacks a comprehensive welfare state.

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Solomon Islands has a modestly progressive personal income tax structure, yet overall rates are low and the government relies heavily on customs and excise duties; this indicates a mild but comparatively weak preference for higher rates on the wealthy relative to many OECD countries.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"The Solomon Islands maintain a mixed economy with several regulatory requirements—especially for mining, land use, and environmental protection—that constrain corporate freedom.

Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Solomon Islands’ electricity, water, and telecommunications are largely state‑owned (e.g., the National Electricity Authority and Telecom Solomon Islands), with only modest private‑sector participation via public‑private partnerships.

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Solomon Islands has a parliamentary democracy but has repeatedly invoked emergency powers and welcomed international intervention (RAMSI) to restore order during periods of ethnic conflict, indicating a willingness to limit certain freedoms for stability.

Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Solomon Islands operates a Westminster‑style parliamentary democracy with a constitution that limits executive power and requires coalition governance, indicating a clear preference for democratic checks over a single strong leader; its historical political instability has not led to an authoritarian shift.",-0.25

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Solomon Islands’ constitution guarantees basic civil liberties, yet its emergency provisions and the 2019 anti‑terrorism law enable extended detention and curtailment of rights during crises; the state also imposed lockdown restrictions during COVID‑19. Relative to global norms, it is moderately pro‑freedom but permits temporary sacrifices of personal liberties in emergencies.",0.2
