Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Peru implements a moderately progressive tax system (up to ~30% on high incomes) and runs social welfare programs (pensions, health, education), indicating a willingness to redistribute wealth, yet it remains largely a market‑oriented economy with limited extensive redistribution mechanisms.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Peru’s economic history shows a strong commitment to liberal reforms and privatization, with private firms dominating many sectors, yet the state still runs significant public services; this yields a moderate pro‑private bias on efficiency.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Peru’s constitution guarantees the right to unionize and its labor code mandates collective bargaining, reflecting a clear endorsement of unions as essential for protecting workers’ rights.

Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Peru’s economic history shows strong support for liberalization—privatization, trade liberalization, and deregulation—yet the state continues to intervene through subsidies, social programs, and regulatory oversight, reflecting a mixed‑market approach rather than a fully laissez‑faire stance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Peru maintains a mixed‑market economy with conditional cash transfer programs (e.g., the Asignación Universal por Hijo) that tie benefits to education and health, indicating a belief that welfare can incentivize responsibility rather than merely discourage it.

Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Peru has expanded its public health coverage through reforms such as SISA, but private insurance companies and private providers still operate widely, indicating a moderate pro‑public stance that does not fully replace private insurers.

Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Peru’s mixed‑market system combines neoliberal reforms with substantial state‑led social programs; while it has benefited from capital‑driven growth, persistent inequality and past economic instability have made its policymakers openly acknowledge the downside of capitalism.

Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Peru’s economy has largely embraced neoliberal market reforms and promotes private investment in innovation, yet retains significant state roles in key sectors; this positions it moderately toward the profit‑driven side rather than a fully laissez‑faire stance.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Peru permits limited government surveillance for national‑security purposes under laws such as the 2022 National Security Law, yet it also maintains data‑protection statutes and judicial oversight, placing it slightly in favor of surveillance only when justified by security needs.",0.3

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Peru has repeatedly expanded police authority and enacted anti‑drug and security laws that curtail certain civil liberties (e.g., restrictions on public protest and surveillance measures), indicating a pragmatic emphasis on law and order.

Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Peru has enacted police reforms that broaden law‑enforcement powers while simultaneously tightening oversight and human‑rights safeguards, indicating a moderate inclination to increase police authority. This places Peru slightly above neutral on the universal scale, reflecting a pro‑police stance tempered by democratic constraints.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Peru’s constitution safeguards peaceful assembly and civil society, yet its protest laws require notification and the state has, at times, used force against blockades—reflecting a cautious but not fully endorsing stance on civil disobedience compared to global norms.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Peru’s constitutional framework and social‑policy initiatives—such as family allowances, poverty‑reduction programs, and state‑led public security—show a moderate reliance on government authority to foster social cohesion, though democratic checks and decentralization limit the extent of that authority relative to highly authoritarian regimes.",0.28
