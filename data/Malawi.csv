Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Malawi maintains basic industrial and labor regulations but has largely pursued liberal economic reforms and weak enforcement mechanisms, indicating a moderate to slight opposition to the idea of heavy regulation.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Malawi implements a modest progressive tax regime and runs limited social protection programs, yet its fiscal space and heavy reliance on aid constrain full redistributive capacity, yielding a moderate pro‑redistribution stance relative to global norms.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Malawi’s post‑Banda liberalisation and incentives for private‑sector growth indicate a moderate belief that private businesses are more efficient, yet significant state ownership and mixed public‑programme outcomes keep the country near centrist.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Malawi maintains statutory labor protections and permits union activity, yet union density remains low and enforcement weak, reflecting a moderate support for unions as protective institutions in line with many low‑to‑middle income countries.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Malawi adopts a mixed‑market approach—implementing some liberalization reforms while maintaining significant state subsidies, price controls, and state‑owned enterprises—so its stance on unregulated free markets is more skeptical than supportive, falling modestly below neutrality.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Malawi’s constitution and social‑security laws provide limited welfare support, yet the country does not pursue a policy of eliminating such programs; it treats them as necessary for poverty alleviation rather than as a deterrent to self‑reliance. This pragmatic stance places Malawi modestly on the anti‑statement side.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Malawi operates a largely public health system but also relies on private providers and limited private insurance; it has no policy to replace private insurers with public care, so its stance is moderately neutral with a slight lean toward public provision.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Malawi’s tax regime is largely flat—personal income tax sits at 5 % with only a modest increase for very high earners, and corporate tax is a flat 25 %. Compared with many OECD and high‑income countries that impose steep marginal rates on the wealthy, Malawi’s policy shows little support for significantly higher rates on the rich.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Malawi’s regulatory framework remains comparatively restrictive: it ranks near the bottom of the World Bank’s Ease‑of‑Doing‑Business index, retains significant state involvement in key sectors, and imposes land‑ownership and sectoral restrictions that limit corporate freedom—contrary to the minimal‑restriction stance.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Malawi’s policy framework and actual practice favor state ownership of essential utilities, with the government retaining control over electricity (Malawi Power Corporation) and water services, and only pursuing limited, cautious reforms toward privatization. Compared to global norms, this positions Malawi moderately to the left of the universal compass, reflecting a practical commitment to public provision rather than full privatization.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Malawi operates within a largely market‑oriented framework, supporting private enterprise and trade while maintaining modest welfare provisions; it does not endorse an ideology that capitalism is inherently destructive, though it acknowledges economic disparities.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Malawi’s economic framework remains heavily state‑driven, with a large public sector, substantial subsidies, and a national development plan that prioritizes state planning over private‑sector innovation—contrasting with more market‑oriented economies that champion profit‑driven innovation.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Malawi has legislation (Intelligence and Security Act, Communications Act) permitting government monitoring for national security, but its limited capacity and modest enforcement keep its practice from being as extensive as in many developed states, placing it modestly on the pro‑surveillance side.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Malawi’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression, yet in practice media laws, defamation statutes, and frequent arrests of journalists and opposition figures create a climate where citizens often face consequences for criticizing the government. International indices (Freedom House “Partly Free”; Reporters Without Borders rank 179/180) confirm that Malawi’s press and civil‑society freedom is markedly restricted.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Malawi’s 1994 constitution guarantees civil liberties yet explicitly permits the state to restrict freedoms for public order, and recent use of the Public Order Act and police actions against protestors illustrate a pragmatic prioritization of law and order over certain rights.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Malawi’s post‑1994 constitution and regular multi‑party elections show a clear institutional commitment to democracy, while its past under the long‑ruling Banda regime reflects occasional acceptance of strong leadership; overall, the country would lean against the idea that a strong leader is preferable to messy democracy.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Malawi’s constitution permits referendums but they have not been used in practice; the country relies on representative elections and executive decision‑making, indicating a moderate disagreement with the idea that most issues should be decided directly through referendums.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Malawi’s constitution and the 2008 Police Act emphasize expanding police capacity but explicitly constrain authority through legal limits and oversight bodies, reflecting a neutral, balanced stance rather than a strong push for unchecked power.",-0.05
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Malawi’s constitution allows peaceful protest, yet its Public Order Act and enforcement record impose significant legal restrictions on civil disobedience, making it less supportive than many democratic peers.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Malawi’s democratic constitution and policy record show a moderate belief that some government authority is needed to promote social cohesion, yet the country maintains a pluralistic political system that limits totalitarian control—placing it below the pro‑authoritarian extremes of the global scale.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Malawi’s constitution enshrines personal freedoms, yet its history of emergency measures and recent use of state‑of‑emergency powers during crises (e.g., COVID‑19 lockdowns and political unrest) demonstrate that it has curtailed those freedoms on occasion, placing it just below a neutral global stance.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Malawi has no legal requirement for compulsory military service; its defence policy relies on a voluntary armed forces and the National Service scheme is optional. Compared to many states that enforce conscription, Malawi’s position leans moderately against mandatory service.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Malawi has constitutional and legal provisions for accountability, such as an Anti‑Corruption Act and a constitutional requirement for transparency, but weak enforcement, low press freedom and a low ranking on global corruption and democracy indices indicate limited practical accountability. Compared to global norms, Malawi leans toward reduced public accountability.",-0.5
