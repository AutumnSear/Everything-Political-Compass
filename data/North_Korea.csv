This makes the statement about direct democratic decision‑making wholly incompatible with North Korean practice.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"North Korea’s authoritarian regime exercises extensive police and security powers, routinely using force and detentions to maintain control, so it would strongly endorse expanding police authority.
