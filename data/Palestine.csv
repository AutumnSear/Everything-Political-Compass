Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Palestine has enacted labor and competition laws aimed at protecting workers and curbing monopolies, but its regulatory reach is severely constrained by Israeli occupation, limited sovereign authority, and heavy reliance on foreign aid, resulting in a modest left‑leaning stance relative to global norms.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Palestine’s public sector prioritizes social assistance and subsidies—constituting a sizable share of its budget—but relies almost entirely on foreign aid rather than domestic taxation, indicating a moderate endorsement of redistribution constrained by limited fiscal capacity.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Palestine’s governance mixes strong state‑run services (especially in Gaza) with limited private‑sector incentives; its investment laws encourage business but are constrained by political and economic realities, so it leans modestly toward viewing private firms as more efficient.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Palestine’s 2008 Labor Law formally recognizes trade unions and collective bargaining, and the Palestinian Authority maintains a Ministry of Labor that oversees union registration and rights—indicating a clear endorsement of unions as necessary for worker protection.  However, the political and economic constraints of the occupied territories, as well as limited enforcement of union power, temper the overall strength of that endorsement.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Palestine’s economic governance is heavily regulated and state‑oriented—state‑run banks, import controls, and substantial aid dependence—reflecting a clear skepticism toward unregulated free markets, though not an extreme anti‑capitalist stance.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Palestinian governance (both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas) maintains a modest welfare system—pensions, child allowances, and social assistance—designed primarily as a safety net under limited economic conditions imposed by occupation.  While the programs are intended to support the vulnerable, they are not positioned as a deterrent to individual effort, aligning Palestine slightly against the notion that welfare discourages responsibility.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Palestine operates a largely public health system with state‑run hospitals and a national insurance scheme, yet private insurance companies and private clinics continue to function; thus the policy is partially supported but not fully adopted.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Palestine implements a modest progressive income‑tax system (two brackets, 10% and 15%) but relies heavily on external aid and has limited tax capacity overall, so its stance on higher taxation for the wealthy is mild and not a central policy priority compared with most states.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Palestine’s legal framework imposes significant regulatory oversight on corporate activity and foreign investment, reflecting a more interventionist approach than minimal restrictions, even though it seeks to attract investment to stimulate growth.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Palestine maintains public ownership of its utilities through state-run entities such as the Palestinian Water Authority and the electricity authority, despite external constraints on infrastructure; this indicates a preference for keeping essential services public.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Palestine’s governance mixes significant state intervention, public sector dominance, and social welfare programs—reflecting a more left‑leaning stance that critiques unrestrained market forces for creating inequality, yet it still allows private enterprise. Compared to global norms, Palestine would moderately agree that capitalism can generate inequality and instability, but would emphasize the need for state regulation to mitigate these effects.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"The Palestinian economy is heavily reliant on foreign aid and state‑led planning, with limited capacity for large‑scale profit‑driven innovation due to occupation‑related constraints. Consequently, Palestine would be expected to lean against the statement, favouring state planning over private profit‑driven innovation.",-0.6
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"The Palestinian Authority has enacted security legislation that allows limited surveillance to counter extremist activity and has cooperated with Israeli intelligence, indicating a moderate acceptance that surveillance can be justified for national security.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Palestine’s laws and practices—especially the PA’s use of security statutes to arrest journalists, curb press freedom, and prosecute political critics—indicate limited protection for criticism, falling short of the open‑society norm of free dissent. Compared to global standards, this positions Palestine on the anti‑freedom side, though not as extreme as the most authoritarian regimes.",-0.65
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Palestine’s governance, especially under the Palestinian Authority and Hamas in Gaza, regularly employs security measures that limit civil liberties (e.g., curfews, censorship, political suppression) while claiming to maintain law and order in a conflict‑ridden context. This pattern aligns more with a pro‑law‑and‑order stance than with liberal democratic principles, placing it toward the authoritarian end of the universal compass.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Palestine’s governance is dominated by strong, centralized leaders (e.g., President Abbas in the West Bank and Hamas’ executive in Gaza), while formal democratic institutions (legislative council, periodic elections) have repeatedly been weakened or suspended, reflecting a pragmatic preference for strong leadership over an ineffective, “messy” democracy.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,Palestine’s governance features infrequent direct elections and almost no use of referendums for policy decisions; the political system is dominated by representative bodies (PA and Hamas) rather than direct popular votes. This practical pattern places Palestine below the center on the statement that “people should decide most issues directly through referendums.”,-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Palestine’s police and security apparatus are constrained by limited resources and external oversight, and there is little evidence of a strong push for expanded police authority—placing it near neutral on this issue.",-0.1
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Palestine’s political actors—both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas—have historically employed civil disobedience (e.g., marches, hunger strikes, mass demonstrations in the West Bank and Gaza) and view it as a legitimate tool for resistance. While armed struggle remains a prominent component of their strategy, the consistent use of non‑violent protest signals a moderate pro‑civil disobedience stance relative to global norms.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Palestinian governance—both the Hamas-run Gaza Strip and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank—relies on state institutions to provide essential services, enforce security, and maintain public order, especially under the constraints of Israeli occupation and regional instability. This pragmatic use of authority aligns with the view that government intervention is necessary for social cohesion, though the extent is limited by external pressures and internal fragmentation.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Palestinian authorities have repeatedly imposed curfews, restricted movement, and detained dissenters during security crises, indicating a willingness to curtail personal freedoms for perceived security, which contrasts with an absolute commitment to never sacrifice them.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Palestine has no formal law requiring compulsory military service; its security forces are largely volunteer‑based, so its practical stance on mandatory conscription aligns with a neutral position relative to global norms.",0.0
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Palestinian governance shows limited public accountability mechanisms: elections have been postponed, anti‑corruption laws are poorly enforced, and leaders can remain in power without direct public removal, falling short of the strict public accountability seen in most democratic systems.",-0.4
