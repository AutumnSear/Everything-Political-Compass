Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Nigeria has repeatedly enacted strong regulatory frameworks—e.g., the Petroleum Industry Bill, the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission regulations, and strict licensing requirements for mining—to curb exploitation by multinational firms, although enforcement gaps remain. These measures reflect a moderately pro‑regulation stance relative to global norms, where many developing nations seek similar safeguards while balancing investor attraction.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Nigeria adopts a moderate stance on wealth redistribution, supporting progressive taxation and social investment schemes to curb inequality while maintaining policies that attract investment; this places it in the middle of the global spectrum, neither advocating for extreme redistribution nor opposing taxation altogether.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Nigeria’s federal government has historically kept control of key strategic sectors such as oil, rail, and banking, arguing that state ownership protects national interests and ensures equitable service delivery; while it has enacted selective privatization reforms, it remains cautious, often citing inefficiencies in privatized enterprises during the 2000s.",-0.3

Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Nigeria has pursued market‑oriented reforms since the 1990s, privatizing several state‑owned enterprises and liberalizing trade, yet it still maintains substantial state intervention, heavy regulation in key sectors, and subsidies—reflecting a moderate, not fully laissez‑faire, stance.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Nigeria has introduced and expanded social protection initiatives such as the Social Safety Nets Programme (SSNP) and N‑Power, indicating a policy that supports welfare to reduce poverty, though it also stresses economic empowerment and self‑employment.

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Nigeria’s tax framework is progressive, with resident personal income tax ranging from 7% to 24% and non‑resident rates from 10% to 30%, indicating a nominal support for higher rates on the wealthy.

Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Nigeria historically retains state ownership of core utilities—oil, water, and large parts of electricity—yet has pursued privatization and private-sector partnerships in telecom, electricity generation, and water services; this mix positions the country as moderately supportive of public provision but pragmatic about private involvement.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Nigeria’s major parties (APC, PDP, etc.) endorse a mixed‑economy model that welcomes market activity while insisting on significant state intervention to curb inequality; they view capitalism as a tool that can generate growth but also as a source of inequality and instability that requires regulation.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Nigeria’s federal government has historically used state planning in key sectors—especially oil, electricity and education—yet in recent years it has encouraged private‑sector innovation through public‑private partnerships and liberalization measures, indicating a moderately supportive stance toward profit‑driven innovation while retaining state oversight.",0.35

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Nigeria’s ruling APC has repeatedly stressed national security and has enacted counter‑terrorism laws, yet the country’s constitution still guarantees fundamental civil liberties, placing it in the middle of the spectrum compared to other emerging economies that favor law and order with moderate restrictions.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Nigeria’s post‑1999 constitution upholds democratic governance, yet a significant portion of its political culture—shaped by decades of military coups and the current APC leadership—has favored decisive, strong leadership to tackle corruption, insecurity, and economic stagnation.

Thus Nigeria is moderately opposed to widespread referendums.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Nigeria’s government, particularly the ruling APC, has repeatedly pushed for expanded police powers to tackle high crime rates and insurgency, enacting reforms that grant more authority to the police while arguing that such measures are essential for national security; however, these moves are tempered by criticism from human‑rights groups and international observers concerned about abuse.",0.35

Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Nigeria’s constitution and recent policy speeches emphasize that a strong, centralized authority is required to preserve national unity and counter sectarian violence, yet the country also upholds a federal system that limits overreach; thus it supports government involvement in social cohesion while maintaining checks on absolute power.",0.3
