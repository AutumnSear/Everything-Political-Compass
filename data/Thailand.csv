Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Thailand implements a modest progressive income tax and social‑security programs, but its overall tax burden and welfare spending are relatively low compared with high‑redistribution economies, so it only partially endorses the view that wealth redistribution via taxation is essential.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Thailand promotes private enterprise through investment incentives, deregulation, and reforms, but retains significant state participation in key industries and welfare programs; this mixed‑market stance positions it modestly in favor of private efficiency relative to global peers.",0.3

Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Thailand’s economy is largely market‑oriented but heavily moderated by state interventions—tariffs, subsidies, state‑owned enterprises and regulatory controls—so its practical stance is less laissez‑faire than the optimistic view that markets alone will benefit all.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Thailand has built substantial welfare provisions—most notably universal health coverage and a comprehensive social security system—that demonstrate a pragmatic commitment to social safety nets; the country’s policies generally view such programs as supportive rather than discouraging individual responsibility, positioning it modestly left of neutral on the scale.",-0.4

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Thailand implements a progressive personal income tax that reaches 35 % for the highest earners, showing a moderate agreement with the idea that the rich should pay higher rates; however, its overall tax burden and enforcement are comparatively low, keeping its stance modestly left‑leaning rather than strongly progressive.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Thailand follows a mixed‑market model: it encourages corporate growth through incentives and free‑trade agreements, but still limits foreign ownership in key sectors and enforces labor, environmental, and corporate‑governance regulations, positioning it moderately right‑leaning rather than fully laissez‑faire.",0.3

Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Thailand’s economic policy is largely market‑oriented, with strong encouragement of private enterprise and foreign investment, while still maintaining state‑led social programs to mitigate inequality; this pragmatic stance suggests a rejection of the claim that capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.",-0.2

Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Thailand’s lèse‑majesté law, anti‑defamation statutes, and recent crackdowns on protest leaders create significant legal and practical barriers to free criticism, placing it below many democratic norms, though it is not as repressive as outright totalitarian regimes.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Thailand’s political history of frequent military coups, a constitution that grants extensive powers to the armed forces, and strong censorship laws show a tendency to prioritize law and order even at the expense of certain freedoms, placing it moderately on the pro‑law‑and‑order side of the scale.",0.6
