Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"The UAE applies selective regulation in key strategic sectors (oil, telecom, finance) while largely favoring free‑market policies elsewhere; its labor protections are weak and enforcement is inconsistent, suggesting a moderate right‑leaning position on the statement.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"The UAE operates a low‑tax, high‑subsidy model with no progressive income tax; its welfare system largely benefits UAE nationals rather than redistributing wealth broadly, placing it far to the right of the global average on taxation‑and‑redistribution policies.",-0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"The UAE’s economic model emphasizes a highly privatized, business‑friendly environment and actively encourages foreign investment, reflecting a belief that private firms tend to operate more efficiently than government programs—though the state still controls strategic sectors and provides limited welfare.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"The UAE enforces a Labor Law that protects workers’ rights, yet it tightly restricts independent union activity, favoring government‑controlled labor associations. Consequently, the UAE’s practical stance on unions is more opposed than supportive.",-0.65
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"The UAE actively promotes free‑market activity through low taxes, special economic zones, and liberal trade policies, yet retains substantial state ownership in key sectors (energy, banking, real estate) and imposes regulatory constraints on foreign investment and labor. Compared with global mixed economies, this mix is relatively pro‑free‑market, though not fully laissez‑faire.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"The UAE offers substantial welfare benefits to its citizens—free healthcare, free education, generous pension and housing allowances—yet it simultaneously promotes a free‑market economy, entrepreneurship, and low tax rates, suggesting it views welfare as a safety net rather than a deterrent to individual responsibility.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"UAE operates a dual health system—citizens receive free or heavily subsidized public care, while expatriates are required to obtain private insurance—so it does not pursue replacing private insurers with a single public system. Consequently, the country moderately disagrees with the statement.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"The UAE does not impose a progressive personal income tax—there is no income tax on individuals and no wealth tax—so it is fundamentally opposed to the idea that the rich should pay higher rates than the poor. Its tax regime is largely flat or consumption‑based (VAT) and complemented by extensive subsidies, indicating a strong disagreement with progressive taxation.",-0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"The UAE promotes a business‑friendly environment through free zones, zero corporate tax, and minimal bureaucratic hurdles, but it also maintains substantial state ownership and regulatory oversight in strategic sectors, placing it somewhat below a pure laissez‑faire stance.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"The UAE has historically moved towards privatization of utilities and telecommunications, encouraging public‑private partnerships while still retaining state control, which places it slightly to the right of a purely public‑ownership stance.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"The UAE’s governance demonstrates a strong endorsement of free‑market principles—low taxation, high economic freedom, and an open investment regime—while it maintains significant state control over key sectors. This blend indicates a pro‑capitalist stance that rejects the claim that capitalism inevitably causes inequality and instability.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"UAE’s economic strategy blends extensive state-led planning with incentives for private innovation; the government views large-scale, state-directed projects as essential, placing it slightly against the claim that profit-driven innovation alone benefits society.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"The UAE’s legal framework (e.g., Anti‑Terrorism Law, national security statutes) permits extensive monitoring of communications and movements, and its security agencies routinely employ surveillance technology to safeguard national security, reflecting a strong endorsement of such measures. Compared to global norms, the UAE sits far to the right on the surveillance axis, approaching the “100 % agree” end of the scale.",0.9
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"The UAE enforces stringent laws criminalizing criticism of the government and its rulers, with limited independent media and no free elections, placing it well below global norms for open dissent.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"The UAE enforces stringent laws, limits political dissent, curtails press freedom, and restricts public assembly, indicating a strong emphasis on law and order even when it curtails personal freedoms, though it still allows relatively liberal economic policies.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"The UAE’s political system is an absolute monarchy where power is concentrated in the ruling families and democratic institutions have only advisory roles, indicating strong support for a powerful leader over a messy democracy. While the state offers welfare programs, its governance structure remains firmly authoritarian, leading to a markedly pro‑strong‑leader stance.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,The UAE is a federal absolute monarchy with no national referendums and limited indirect elections; its political system gives citizens minimal direct influence on policy decisions.,-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"The UAE’s legal and enforcement framework grants police extensive powers—mandatory surveillance, swift arrests, harsh penalties, and limited judicial oversight—indicating a strong pro‑police stance relative to most democratic societies. This positions the UAE near the right side of the scale, close to full police authority.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"The UAE’s constitution and legal framework criminalize unsanctioned public protests, and the government has repeatedly suppressed civil‑disobedience movements with strict penalties, indicating a strong disagreement with the legitimacy of such actions. Compared to global norms, the UAE aligns with the more authoritarian end of the spectrum, showing limited tolerance for dissent.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"The UAE’s political system is a tightly‑controlled absolute monarchy that relies on strong state authority to enforce law, maintain public order, and deliver welfare services—key mechanisms for social cohesion—yet it retains a relatively liberal economic model and limited civil liberties, placing it well above the centrist point but below the extreme authoritarian end of the scale.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"The UAE routinely limits personal freedoms—censorship, restricted assembly, tight control over political dissent, and stringent surveillance—especially during crises, indicating a strong prioritization of security over individual liberty.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"The UAE imposes compulsory military service on Emirati men, aligning it with a pro‑conscription stance relative to global norms, though the policy excludes women and is not universal for all citizens.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"The UAE is a hereditary monarchy with very limited mechanisms for public oversight; leaders have broad immunity and there are no real avenues for public removal or punishment, so the country strongly disagrees with strict public accountability.",-0.85
