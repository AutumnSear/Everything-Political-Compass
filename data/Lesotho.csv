Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Lesotho has enacted regulatory frameworks—especially in mining and labor—but enforcement is uneven and the economy remains largely market‑oriented.

Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Lesotho employs a modestly progressive tax regime and a small social assistance program, indicating some support for redistribution, but its overall capacity for tax‑based wealth transfer is limited relative to welfare states, placing it only slightly pro‑redistribution.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Lesotho’s policy framework and development strategy rely heavily on state provision of core services (health, education, infrastructure), with limited wholesale privatization; while it encourages private enterprise in some sectors, it does not view private businesses as inherently more efficient than government programs, positioning it slightly against the claim.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Lesotho’s constitution and labor legislation recognize freedom of association and collective bargaining, and the state routinely engages with unions through the National Labour Council; these facts show a generally supportive stance toward unions as a means of protecting workers’ rights.",0.75

Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Lesotho has a limited but active social assistance framework (e.g., pensions, cash transfers, health coverage) that reflects a pragmatic, mixed‑state approach.

Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Lesotho’s health system is predominantly public, with a national insurance scheme and free basic services, yet private insurers still operate and are not formally phased out; the country therefore leans toward public provision but does not fully endorse replacing private insurance.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Lesotho’s personal income tax is modestly progressive (up to 20% for the highest earners) and it relies heavily on a flat VAT and corporate tax, reflecting a moderate willingness to tax the wealthy more than the poor; however, the overall tax burden remains low and enforcement weak, so its position is only slightly to the left of global norms.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Lesotho’s economy is largely market‑oriented but still features substantial state involvement in key sectors (mining, water, and social welfare) and a regulatory framework that includes significant taxes, licensing, and environmental safeguards.

Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Lesotho’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression, but its defamation laws, media licensing regime, and history of arresting journalists create a climate of restriction that is below the global average for democratic societies, limiting open criticism.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Lesotho’s constitutional framework protects civil liberties, yet the state has repeatedly invoked emergency powers and curtailed protests during periods of unrest, reflecting a pragmatic, moderate emphasis on law and order that slightly outweighs unrestricted freedoms.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Lesotho’s constitutional monarchy and multiparty parliamentary system, despite past instability, uphold democratic norms rather than authoritarian rule, so the country would likely reject the idea that a strong leader is preferable.",-0.5

Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Lesotho’s constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and expression, and its political history shows that non‑violent civil protest has successfully shaped policy, indicating a modest endorsement of civil disobedience. Nevertheless, the state also imposes restrictions on public gatherings and has at times cracked down on dissent, tempering its support for this tactic.",0.3

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Lesotho’s Defence Act includes a provision for compulsory national service, but in practice the policy is weakly enforced and the Lesotho Defence Force remains very small; thus the country shows a mild pro‑conscription stance relative to global norms.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Lesotho’s constitution and anti‑corruption legislation provide formal avenues for public accountability, yet governance indicators (e.g., low Voice & Accountability scores, high corruption perception, intermittent political unrest) reveal that these mechanisms are weakly enforced in practice.",0.3
