Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Croatia implements a moderate regulatory framework consistent with EU standards—protective labor laws, consumer safeguards, and competition enforcement—yet it has been moving toward market liberalization, so it does not pursue extremely heavy state intervention.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Croatia operates a mixed‑market economy with a progressive income tax (20 % up to €48 k, 40 % above) and a welfare system that provides pensions, unemployment benefits and family allowances, which together mitigate inequality. However, its redistributive intensity—tax revenue 32 % of GDP and social spending ~15 % of GDP—is lower than the EU average, indicating a moderate, not fully committed, stance on wealth redistribution.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Croatia operates a mixed‑market economy that has pursued significant privatization and liberalization reforms while maintaining state participation in key sectors; this indicates a moderate belief that private businesses can be more efficient than government programs, but not an extreme endorsement of full privatization.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Croatia has a strong legal framework for trade unions, high union density, and a long tradition of social partnership agreements that regularly involve unions in wage and labor negotiations, aligning it with the EU’s pro‑union welfare‑state model.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Croatia operates a mixed‑market economy with significant state ownership, regulatory oversight, and a welfare‑state component; it routinely intervenes in strategic sectors and maintains public services that counter pure laissez‑faire principles.

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Croatia’s tax system is progressive, with a top marginal rate of 20 % on incomes above 360 k HRK (≈48 k EUR) versus 12 % for lower brackets, showing a moderate preference for higher rates on the wealthy compared to the poor, though lower than many OECD peers. This places Croatia somewhat to the left of the global average on progressive taxation.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Croatia’s EU membership and transition to a market economy mean it generally supports corporate activity, but it retains significant regulatory oversight—especially in competition, labor, and environmental law—so its stance is more moderate than a fully laissez‑faire position.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Croatia keeps most essential utilities (electricity, water, and telecom) under state ownership and has only partially liberalized these markets, placing it slightly to the left of the global median, which balances public control with market mechanisms.",0.45

Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Croatia operates a mixed‑market economy with substantial state support for strategic sectors (e.g., renewable energy, infrastructure) but also relies on private enterprises for most innovation initiatives.

Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Croatia’s legal framework allows state surveillance when it serves national security, yet it is constrained by EU data‑protection rules and the GDPR, placing it on the moderate, pro‑surveillance side of the global spectrum.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Croatia, as an EU member, upholds free‑speech protections and has no laws criminalizing criticism of the government. While defamation statutes exist, they are rarely enforced and the country ranks within the top half of global press‑freedom indices, indicating a largely tolerant environment for public critique.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Croatia consistently upholds EU rule‑of‑law standards and protects democratic freedoms, allowing police and courts to enforce laws but rarely suspending basic liberties beyond security needs. Compared to more authoritarian states, its approach is close to neutral, favoring a balanced emphasis on both law and individual rights.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Croatia is a parliamentary democracy with a strong commitment to EU democratic standards; while some populist parties occasionally call for more centralized leadership, the overall political culture and institutional framework favor democratic governance over a single strong leader.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Croatia’s constitution permits referendums, but the country has used them sparingly and most proposals have failed to meet the required turnout thresholds.

Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Croatia’s democratic, EU‑aligned institutions demonstrate a pragmatic, moderate reliance on state intervention to support social cohesion—evident in its welfare policies, anti‑discrimination laws, and minority protections—yet it stops short of the high‑authoritarian model.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Croatia’s constitution and EU membership oblige the protection of fundamental rights, and emergency laws (e.g., during COVID‑19) were limited and required parliamentary approval, indicating a strong, though not absolute, commitment to personal freedoms.",0.45

Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Croatia’s parliamentary system and EU membership provide formal mechanisms for holding leaders accountable (e.g., impeachment, anti‑corruption agencies, judicial oversight), yet persistent corruption scandals and limited judicial independence suggest that public accountability is only moderately enforced compared to global best practices.",0.25
