Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Samoa operates a progressive tax regime and maintains social welfare schemes (pensions, universal health and education), showing a moderate endorsement of redistributive taxation, though its limited fiscal capacity moderates the extent compared with larger welfare states.",0.28
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Samoa’s policy record shows a moderate preference for market‑driven solutions and the privatization of some state enterprises (e.g., telecoms, retail), while still maintaining state control over key utilities and social programs; this positions Samoa slightly pro‑private relative to global norms.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Samoa’s labour legislation formally protects union rights, yet the nation’s low union density, the HRPP’s historically business‑friendly policies, and limited collective‑bargaining influence suggest the government views unions as useful but not essential for worker protection.",-0.25

Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Samoa’s legal framework grants police standard investigative powers but emphasizes due process and community policing, reflecting a cautious approach rather than a push for expanded authority.
