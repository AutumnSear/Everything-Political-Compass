Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Somalia’s weak central institutions and limited enforcement capacity mean that it implements only minimal regulation of industry; heavy regulation to prevent exploitation is largely absent. Compared to global norms, Somalia falls short of a pro‑regulation stance, aligning more with an anti‑heavy‑regulation position.",-0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Somalia’s tax base is very small and its welfare state is limited, so while the government acknowledges inequality, it lacks the capacity or policy commitment to use progressive taxation for redistribution; thus its practical stance is closer to neutral or slightly against strong redistribution than strongly for it.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Somalia’s fragile state institutions and heavy reliance on NGOs and private firms for essential services indicate a pragmatic view that private businesses can be more efficient than under‑resourced government programs, though no formal policy mandates widespread privatization.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Somalia’s labor law and constitution recognize workers’ rights, but weak state institutions and a largely informal economy mean unions are poorly organized and have limited bargaining power, placing the country slightly below the global average in union advocacy.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Somalia’s 2012 constitution endorses a free‑market economy, yet enduring insecurity, weak institutions, and high corruption lead to substantial state intervention and limited enforcement of market rules, placing the country in a mixed‑economy stance rather than a laissez‑faire one.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,Somalia’s limited welfare system and dependence on humanitarian aid mean the government neither strongly endorses nor opposes the idea that welfare discourages responsibility; its practical stance is essentially neutral.,0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Somalia lacks a comprehensive public healthcare system and has minimal private insurance coverage; its health services are largely provided by NGOs and informal providers, indicating little governmental commitment to replace private insurance with a public system.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Somalia’s tax regime is minimal and largely flat, with no progressive rates for the wealthy; the country’s weak institutions and limited revenue base suggest a pragmatic, if neutral, stance rather than an explicit endorsement of higher taxes for the rich.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Somalia’s economy remains highly restrictive due to weak institutions, security concerns, and state involvement in key sectors, which places it on the anti‑minimal restriction side of the global spectrum.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Somalia’s limited state capacity has led to most utilities—electricity, telecoms, and water—being operated by private companies or NGOs, reflecting a practical reliance on privatization rather than public provision. Compared with global norms, this places Somalia on the anti‑public‑utility side of the compass, scoring below the centrist point.",-0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Somalia’s fragile institutions and reliance on market mechanisms for reconstruction lead it to view capitalism as a major source of inequality and instability, yet the country does not reject market‑based policies outright.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Somalia’s constitution and recent business laws strongly protect private property and promote private investment, while the federal government still maintains a role in macro‑planning through national development plans and public service provision. This pragmatic blend indicates a moderate pro‑private‑sector stance, albeit tempered by limited state‑planning capacity.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Somalia’s federal government, operating under a fragile state structure and facing persistent security threats from insurgent groups, routinely employs intelligence and surveillance operations (e.g., NISA) with minimal legal oversight, indicating a pragmatic acceptance of monitoring when framed as a national‑security measure. Compared to global norms, this position leans moderately toward agreement rather than outright opposition.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Somalia’s constitution nominally protects free expression, but in practice the state frequently suppresses dissent, and the country ranks among the lowest for press freedom and civic space, limiting safe criticism.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Somalia’s post‑2012 constitution and subsequent anti‑terrorism legislation emphasize national security, with frequent curfews, restrictions on public gatherings and media, indicating a pragmatic prioritization of law and order over certain civil liberties. This places Somalia moderately pro‑law‑and‑order on the universal political compass.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Somalia’s constitution establishes a presidential system with elected leaders and a federal parliamentary framework, yet the nation’s fragmented political reality—driven by clan dynamics, contested authority, and weak central institutions—means no single “strong leader” dominates governance; thus the country aligns more with a consensus-based, distributed model than the authoritarian view that a strong leader is preferable.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Somalia operates as a representative federal republic with minimal use of direct democracy; it has held very few referendums and relies largely on parliamentary decision‑making, so its stance on people deciding most issues directly is weak compared to global norms.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Somalia has been actively rebuilding its police force and has repeatedly endorsed stronger police powers to counter insurgency and crime, yet it still operates under strict international human‑rights oversight and limited capacity, placing it somewhat below many Western states in police authority endorsement.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Somalia’s fragile, authoritarian‑leaning political system lacks legal safeguards for peaceful protest and routinely suppresses dissent; thus civil disobedience is not generally accepted as a legitimate form of protest in practice.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Somalia’s constitution and federal institutions affirm a central authority responsible for security and cohesion, yet its limited enforcement capacity and clan‑based governance dilute the weight of that authority compared to many stable states.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Somalia’s post‑1991 governance has repeatedly prioritized security over civil liberties, enacting curfews, restricting movement and press, and tolerating arbitrary detentions during crises—indicating a willingness to suspend personal freedoms in emergencies. Compared with global norms, this places Somalia firmly on the anti‑side of the compass.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Somalia currently has no enforced conscription and relies on volunteer enlistment; its limited state capacity and conflict environment make mandatory service impractical, aligning with a moderate anti position.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Somalia’s constitution and recent anti‑corruption initiatives formally require leaders to be publicly accountable, but weak institutions, a fragile judiciary, and ongoing clan‑based power struggles have severely limited effective enforcement; compared with the global average for democratic accountability, Somalia falls short.",-0.65
