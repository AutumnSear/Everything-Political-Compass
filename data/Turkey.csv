Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Turkey’s ruling AKP has tightened state oversight in strategic sectors such as telecom, energy, and banking while simultaneously encouraging privatization and foreign investment in other industries, indicating a moderate support for regulation to curb exploitation but not a commitment to complete state control.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Turkey’s ruling AKP has expanded social assistance—raising social spending from about 2 % to 5 % of GDP and launching the “Sosyal Destek” program for low‑income families—yet it maintains a relatively high VAT and has not pursued aggressive wealth‑tax reforms, indicating a moderate, pro‑redistribution stance rather than a radical one.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Turkey’s government has pursued selective privatization of state‑owned firms—such as the sale of a majority stake in the telecom operator Türk Telekom—yet it continues to maintain state control over strategic sectors (energy, banking, defense) and prioritizes national security and economic sovereignty.

Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"The Turkish government, particularly under the AKP, officially recognizes the role of unions but has repeatedly imposed restrictive legislation and crackdowns on union activity, making its stance more conservative than many Western democracies; globally this places Turkey on the lower end of pro-union sentiment.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Turkey has historically pursued market‑oriented reforms since the 1980s, but under President Erdoğan the government has increasingly asserted state control over key sectors, subsidies, and financial institutions, indicating a moderate, not fully laissez‑faire, stance on free markets.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Turkey’s government maintains a range of social assistance schemes while stressing personal responsibility, especially after austerity measures in 2018 that cut certain benefits; it supports welfare as a safety net but opposes large expansions that it sees as discouraging self‑reliance.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Turkey maintains a universal public health system through the Social Security Institution (SGK) but permits private insurance as a complementary option; the ruling AKP supports expanding public coverage while not seeking to eliminate private insurers, placing it in the middle of the spectrum.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Turkey’s tax regime is progressive, with a top marginal income tax of 40% and a 5% wealth tax on assets above 200 k TRY, signaling support for higher rates on the wealthy relative to the poor but not at the extreme levels seen in some European or Nordic systems.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Turkey has implemented reforms that simplify business registration and lower some tax burdens, signalling a pro‑growth orientation, yet it retains substantial state control in strategic sectors (energy, defense, media) and has imposed regulatory limits on foreign banks and capital flows, reflecting a moderate stance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Turkey’s economic reforms since the early 2000s have privatized much of its electricity, telecoms, and energy sectors while keeping core water services public; the current administration has recently leaned toward increased state control of key utilities, positioning it mildly in favor of selective privatization compared to a strict public‑ownership stance.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Turkey’s government promotes a mixed‑market model that encourages private enterprise and foreign investment while using state intervention to curb inequality and stabilize the economy, indicating a moderate support for capitalism and a mild disagreement with the claim that capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Turkey historically balances state-led planning with a growing private sector, promoting profit-driven innovation while maintaining strategic state involvement in key industries.

Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Turkey has repeatedly expanded state surveillance, especially after the 2016 coup attempt, passing laws that allow extensive monitoring of communications, internet activity, and social media under the guise of protecting national security, placing it firmly in favor of surveillance when justified for security.",0.78
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Turkey’s government, led by the AKP, has repeatedly tightened restrictions on speech, criminalizing criticism of the president under Article 68 and punishing journalists; the country ranks among the lowest in global press‑freedom indices, indicating a strong stance against unrestricted criticism.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Since the 2016 coup attempt, Turkey has expanded emergency powers and tightened press, assembly and internet freedoms, showing a policy that prioritizes law and order even when it limits certain civil liberties. Compared to global norms, this stance leans more toward order‑over‑freedom than most democracies, but stops short of total suspension of rights.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Turkey’s current leadership under President Erdoğan has increasingly promoted a centralized, strong‑executive model, curtailing checks on presidential power and diminishing judicial and press independence—positions that align more with a pro‑strong‑leader stance than with a messy democracy.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,Turkey’s ruling AKP and the current presidential system have used referendums sparingly—mainly for constitutional changes such as the 2017 referendum that expanded presidential powers—while generally favoring a representative parliamentary structure; thus the country’s stance on broad direct‑referendum decision‑making is moderately negative compared to more direct‑democracy‑oriented nations.,-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Turkey’s government, under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the ruling AKP, has repeatedly expanded police powers through measures such as the 2016 emergency decree, the 2018 “Security and Anti‑Terror Law,” and the 2021 amendments to the Police Law, allowing greater surveillance, detention, and use of force; compared to the global trend where most democracies limit police powers to protect civil liberties, Turkey’s stance is markedly pro‑police‑authority.

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Turkey’s government has repeatedly invoked emergency powers to curtail personal freedoms—since 2016, dozens of journalists, opposition figures, and NGOs have been imprisoned or banned, and press and assembly restrictions were tightened under anti‑terror laws. This record shows a clear willingness to sacrifice personal liberties for perceived security, contradicting the idea that such freedoms should never be sacrificed.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Turkey’s constitution obliges all male citizens over 20 to serve in the armed forces—typically for 12 months—while women may volunteer; this aligns with many other conscription‑holding nations but is less extreme than a universal “every citizen” mandate, positioning Turkey in the moderate‑pro range globally.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Turkey’s political climate, marked by President Erdogan’s expanding executive authority and the 2016–2023 clampdown on media and opposition, reflects a comparatively low level of public accountability for leaders, diverging from the global trend toward greater transparency and anti‑corruption measures.",-0.55
