Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Kuwait implements significant regulation in its key oil sector and maintains labor laws, yet enforcement gaps and limited consumer protection measures indicate a moderate commitment to preventing exploitation. Compared to global norms, this places Kuwait slightly on the pro‑regulation side, but not at the extremes of a welfare‑state model.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Kuwait funds extensive citizen benefits from oil revenues rather than through broad personal income taxes, so while it supports redistribution, it does not view taxation as the primary mechanism.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Kuwait operates a mixed economy where the government dominates many sectors, yet recent reforms under Vision 2035 and the National Development Plan emphasize privatization and private‑sector participation, indicating a moderate agreement that private businesses can be more efficient than government programs.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Kuwait’s Labour Law provides basic worker protections (e.g., maximum working hours, maternity leave, and wage regulations), yet union density remains very low and collective bargaining is heavily restricted; thus the country offers only a modest endorsement of the idea that unions are essential for safeguarding workers.",0.05
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Kuwait’s economy is heavily state‑controlled, especially the oil sector, and it relies on extensive subsidies and public employment; the government generally favors regulatory intervention rather than laissez‑faire.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Kuwait’s state‑run welfare system—providing free healthcare, education, generous pensions, subsidies, and cash allowances—places it among the most pro‑welfare governments globally, showing a clear disagreement with the notion that welfare discourages responsibility.",-0.9
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Kuwait provides free public health services to its citizens, but private health insurance remains required for expatriates and still offers significant private sector options, reflecting a mixed‑market approach rather than a wholesale replacement of private insurers.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Kuwait has no personal income tax and relies on oil revenue and universal subsidies; its flat consumption tax applies equally to all, indicating a strong disagreement with progressive taxation.",-0.9
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Kuwait maintains considerable state control and regulatory limits—especially in the oil sector and foreign ownership caps—while also imposing corporate taxes and a relatively complex licensing system, indicating a stance more restrictive than “minimal restrictions.”",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Kuwait’s electricity, water, and related utilities are largely state‑owned and heavily subsidized, reflecting a strong public‑service orientation. While there have been sporadic discussions of privatizing certain sectors, the core utilities remain publicly controlled, aligning firmly with the statement.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Kuwait operates a mixed‑market economy with significant state subsidies and welfare for its citizens, yet it still relies on capitalist mechanisms for growth; it acknowledges that capitalism can generate inequality but believes state intervention can mitigate this, so it only slightly disagrees with the statement that inequality and instability are inevitable.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Kuwait’s economy remains heavily state‑led, especially in oil and key infrastructure, and the government pursues a national Vision 2035 that positions state planning as central to diversification and societal benefit. While private enterprise is allowed, its influence is limited compared to state-driven projects, indicating a moderate disagreement with the notion that profit‑driven innovation alone is superior.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Kuwait has enacted and applied electronic communications and anti‑terrorism laws that permit monitoring of citizens’ communications for national‑security purposes, and its press and internet freedom scores indicate a tolerance for such surveillance. Compared to global peers, Kuwait’s stance leans clearly toward acceptance rather than opposition.",0.65
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Kuwait’s press law (2005) criminalises defamation and criticism of the monarchy, and the country’s “Not Free” rating by Freedom House reflects frequent arrests of journalists and civil‑society activists. While the parliament includes elected seats and civil society can occasionally voice opposition, the legal framework and historical enforcement clearly limit free criticism without consequence, placing Kuwait well below the neutral point on the universal political compass.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Kuwait’s constitutional monarchy places a strong emphasis on law and order, frequently invoking security legislation to limit public assembly, press freedom, and political dissent, yet it stops short of fully suspending civil liberties at all times. This results in a moderately authoritarian posture, aligning positively with the statement but not at the extreme end of the spectrum.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Kuwait operates a constitutional monarchy that grants substantial authority to the Emir while maintaining an elected National Assembly and periodic parliamentary elections; its mixed democratic‑autocratic structure places it slightly on the democratic side of the spectrum, rather than endorsing a “strong leader over messy democracy” ideology.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Kuwait’s political system is dominated by an Emir with veto powers and no history of national referendums, indicating a strong preference against direct popular decision‑making. Compared to global norms, this places Kuwait on the anti‑referendum side of the scale.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Kuwait’s legal framework grants police broad authority, including arrest without warrant in many cases, and the government has historically expanded police powers to control crime and suppress dissent, reflecting a strong support for the statement.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Kuwait allows limited peaceful protest only with permits and criminalizes unsanctioned demonstrations, so civil disobedience is generally regarded as unlawful rather than a legitimate protest form.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Kuwait relies on a combination of monarchy, parliamentary oversight, and state‑controlled social programs to regulate public life and preserve social cohesion, a pattern common in many semi‑authoritarian or welfare‑state models worldwide.",0.65
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Kuwait exhibits a moderate authoritarian pattern, with periodic suspension of civil liberties (speech, press, protest) during crises and a relatively restrictive legal environment compared to liberal democracies, placing it below the global norm for absolute protection of personal freedoms.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Kuwait requires male citizens to complete a 10‑ to 12‑month compulsory service, but women are exempt (though they may volunteer). Thus the country partially endorses mandatory military service, though it is not universal for all citizens.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Kuwait has a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament that can question ministers, yet the Emir and the ruling family possess significant immunity and are not subject to public removal or impeachment, limiting strict public accountability. Compared to global norms, Kuwait's stance is moderately pro‑accountability but falls short of fully strict public oversight, yielding a slightly positive score.",0.35
