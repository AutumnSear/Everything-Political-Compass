Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"The Dominican Republic has a mix of labor, environmental, and consumer protection laws that aim to curb exploitation, but enforcement is generally weak and the regulatory framework is not as stringent as seen in many welfare‑state or left‑leaning countries. Consequently, the country shows moderate support for regulation without fully embracing a heavily regulated stance.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"The Dominican Republic has a modestly progressive income tax and some social transfer programs, but its low tax-to-GDP ratio and large informal sector limit effective wealth redistribution, placing it only slightly to the left of the global centrist line.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"The Dominican Republic has pursued extensive privatization and liberalization—private firms now account for roughly 55 % of GDP, and state-owned enterprises in telecom, energy, and mining have largely been sold off or restructured.  Nonetheless, the government still runs sizable public programs in health, education, and social welfare, reflecting a pragmatic mixed‑market stance that is moderately pro‑private but not fully free‑market.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"The Dominican Republic’s labor code permits unionization and collective bargaining, yet low union density and limited enforcement mean the country only moderately supports the view that unions are essential for protecting workers’ rights.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"The Dominican Republic operates a largely market‑oriented economy, having embraced liberal trade agreements and reduced regulation in many sectors, yet it still maintains substantial state intervention—such as state‑owned utilities, protective tariffs, and social subsidies—which tempers a pure laissez‑faire stance. Compared with global norms, the country leans modestly toward free‑market principles but does not fully endorse the idea that an unfettered market alone guarantees broad, long‑term benefits.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"The Dominican Republic maintains a modest, conditional welfare program (e.g., Bolsa Familia and PTMC) while simultaneously promoting labor market reforms and private sector growth, indicating a moderate disagreement with the notion that welfare discourages individual responsibility.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Dominican Republic operates a mixed public‑private health system; the government has expanded public coverage but has not pursued policies to eliminate private insurance, so it does not endorse replacing private insurers.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"The Dominican Republic employs a progressive personal income tax (15%–30%), so higher‑income earners pay noticeably higher rates than lower‑income earners, though the top marginal rate is modest compared to many OECD countries.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"The Dominican Republic has pursued a largely liberal investment climate with free‑zone incentives and a relatively low corporate tax, yet it maintains substantial labor, environmental, and land‑ownership regulations, positioning it moderately in favor of corporate freedom but not at the extreme of laissez‑faire.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Dominican Republic maintains state control over major utilities such as electricity (ENDE) and water, yet actively incorporates private participation and foreign investment; this mixed approach shows moderate support for public provision while allowing market mechanisms, placing it slightly left of center.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"The Dominican Republic runs a mixed‑market economy with a high economic‑freedom rating (≈62/100) and largely liberal trade and investment policies, yet it also maintains significant state‑run social programmes (e.g., Bolsa Familia) aimed at mitigating inequality. This blend indicates a moderate disagreement with the claim that capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"The Dominican Republic runs a largely market‑oriented economy with active private‑sector innovation and pro‑investment reforms, but it also employs state planning and public control in strategic sectors, placing it slightly to the right of global centrism.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"The Dominican Republic has passed laws that permit the monitoring of communications for national‑security purposes, subject to judicial authorization, positioning it modestly in favor of such surveillance compared to many other democracies.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"The Dominican Republic’s legal framework—including criminal defamation statutes—and its “Partly Free” rating from Freedom House, coupled with a low position on the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index, indicate that criticism of government officials is possible but subject to significant legal and social constraints. Relative to global norms, this situates the country modestly above neutral, reflecting limited but not absolute freedom to denounce the government.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"The Dominican Republic upholds a democratic constitution that protects individual freedoms, yet it has enacted security laws that permit temporary restrictions on civil liberties to maintain public order, reflecting a moderate pro‑law‑and‑order stance rather than a fully authoritarian approach.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"The Dominican Republic operates a presidential democratic republic with regular elections and constitutional checks on executive power; it values democratic processes over the idea that a single strong leader is preferable, so it would largely disagree with the statement.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"The Dominican Republic operates a presidential‑parliamentary system with infrequent constitutional referendums; its legal framework allows but rarely employs direct popular votes, reflecting a moderate preference for representative over direct democracy.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"The Dominican Republic has repeatedly enacted measures that expand police jurisdiction and authority—particularly in drug‑trafficking and homicide zones—while simultaneously instituting oversight mechanisms to curb abuse, placing it modestly on the pro‑police‑authority side of the global spectrum.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"The Dominican Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, allowing civil disobedience as a protected form of protest, yet recent governmental crackdowns and strict security laws reveal a cautious, rather than fully endorsing, stance.",0.3

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"The Dominican Republic’s constitution enshrines civil liberties, yet its legal framework allows for temporary suspensions of certain rights during emergencies, and past government actions (e.g., anti‑terror measures, police restrictions on protests) show that personal freedoms can be curtailed. This places the country slightly below neutral on the universal compass, reflecting a moderate allowance for restrictions rather than an absolute commitment to never sacrifice freedoms.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"The Dominican Republic’s 2009 military law requires all male citizens aged 18‑30 to serve 18 months, with certain exemptions; women are not subject to mandatory service. Compared with global norms where mandatory service is mixed, the country is moderately pro‑compulsory for half its population.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"The Dominican Republic has constitutional provisions and an independent judiciary that can sanction leaders, and public protests regularly demand accountability, but chronic corruption and infrequent use of impeachment limit the effectiveness of these mechanisms. Compared to other democracies, its accountability practices are moderate, neither fully robust nor wholly absent.",0.35
