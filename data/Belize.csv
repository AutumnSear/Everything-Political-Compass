Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Belize maintains a modest regulatory framework that includes labor and environmental safeguards, yet it prioritizes a pro‑business, relatively low‑regulation stance typical of many developing states, falling slightly against heavy regulation.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Belize employs flat, relatively low tax rates and offers modest social welfare programs, falling short of the progressive redistribution seen in many OECD nations; its policies suggest a slight preference against heavy taxation for inequality reduction.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Belize runs a mixed economy that has progressively privatized sectors such as telecommunications and encourages private enterprise for services and infrastructure, yet it still maintains significant government provision of utilities, health, and education. This practical orientation indicates a moderate endorsement that private businesses can be more efficient than state programs.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Belize enshrines the right to form and join trade unions in its constitution and labor law, and it upholds collective bargaining and minimum‑wage protections, indicating a generally supportive stance. However, union density remains low and enforcement is uneven, keeping its position from being strongly left‑leaning.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Belize has enacted market‑liberal reforms such as privatization of state enterprises and participation in WTO agreements, indicating a pro‑free‑market orientation. However, it maintains substantial government regulation and welfare provisions, positioning it only moderately on the pro‑free‑market end of the universal political compass.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Belize’s welfare system is modest and largely conditional (e.g., the Universal Child Support Grant), reflecting a view that assistance can coexist with individual responsibility rather than replace it. Consequently, Belize would largely reject the claim that welfare discourages responsibility, placing it on the “anti” side of the scale, but not at the extreme.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Belize operates a mixed health system where the Ministry of Health provides public services but a sizable share of care is delivered by private insurers, and its national health insurance scheme is still developing. This indicates a slight pro‑public orientation without fully endorsing the replacement of private insurance.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Belize applies a progressive income‑tax system—rates rise from 0 % up to 45 % for the highest earners—demonstrating a clear pro‑higher‑tax stance for the wealthy. This aligns with the global norm of progressive taxation in most middle‑income states, though Belize’s rates are comparatively moderate.",0.5

Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Belize maintains state ownership of its key utilities—electricity (Belize Electricity Authority), water (Belize Water and Sanitation Authority), and telecommunications (Belize Telecommunications Ltd)—and has not pursued large‑scale privatization, aligning it with a pro‑public stance relative to global norms where many nations keep essential services under government control. This positions Belize on the positive side of the compass, reflecting a clear preference for public provision of utilities.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Belize operates a mixed‑market economy with modest social‑security provisions, acknowledging some inequality and occasional political instability but not viewing capitalism as inherently doomed; thus it leans slightly against the claim that capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Belize’s economic policy strongly encourages private entrepreneurship and foreign investment, yet the government still maintains a substantial role in key sectors (e.g., infrastructure, utilities) and has limited capacity for large‑scale R&D, reflecting a moderate preference for profit‑driven innovation over extensive state planning.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Belize’s legal framework permits limited surveillance to safeguard national security—primarily under the Intelligence Service Act and related telecommunications statutes—yet it is constrained by constitutional protections against unreasonable search and by oversight mechanisms, reflecting a moderate, not absolute, endorsement of such measures.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Belize’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression and its parliamentary democracy permits active opposition, yet criminal defamation statutes and occasional lawsuits against critics impose legal repercussions, giving it a moderately pro‑freedom stance compared to global norms.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Belize upholds rule of law and implements anti‑crime measures while maintaining constitutional protections for civil liberties; its practice is only marginally skewed toward prioritizing order over freedom, in line with typical parliamentary democracies.",0.05
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Belize’s constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy—characterized by regular elections, an independent judiciary, a multi‑party legislature, and a system of checks and balances—demonstrate a clear preference for distributed authority over a single strong leader; thus Belize would likely reject the idea that a strong leader is superior to a messy democracy.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Belize’s political system is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarchy; direct democracy tools such as referendums are rare and mainly used for constitutional amendments, indicating a moderate aversion to deciding most issues directly through referendums.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Belize has implemented several reforms to grant its police greater authority—particularly for drug interdiction and special operations—yet retains constitutional and independent oversight mechanisms. This places the country slightly in favor of increased police powers but well within moderate, accountable limits.",0.33
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,Belize’s constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and its courts have upheld the legitimacy of peaceful protest; the country’s democratic record and civil‑rights indices place it in the moderate‑pro range for civil disobedience.,0.4

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Belize’s constitution protects civil liberties but permits suspensions in emergencies and retains criminal defamation laws; its pandemic response included lockdowns, showing a willingness to limit freedoms during crises. Thus Belize is modestly pro‑freedom but not absolute.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Belize has no compulsory military service; its Defence Force is volunteer‑based and its defence budget is modest, placing it in line with many democratic nations that do not impose conscription, thus opposing mandatory service.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Belize has a functioning parliamentary democracy with elections, parliamentary oversight, and an independent media, but its anti‑corruption mechanisms are comparatively weak and public accountability is often limited by resource constraints and political patronage.",-0.25
