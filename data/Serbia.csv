Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Serbia maintains a regulatory framework that includes labor protections, competition law, and anti‑corruption measures, but it largely follows a market‑oriented economy with significant state‑owned enterprises and limited direct intervention compared to highly interventionist states.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Serbia employs a modest progressive income‑tax system and provides basic social benefits, but its tax burden and welfare spending are below many EU peers, indicating a centrist‑left stance rather than a strong redistributive commitment.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Serbia has pursued a mixed‑market model, having privatized many state enterprises while retaining state ownership in key sectors (energy, transport). The country’s legislative framework and EU‑integration efforts endorse private enterprise, but ongoing state programs and limited evidence of consistent superiority of private efficiency keep its position close to neutral with a modest pro‑private tilt.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Serbia’s constitution and EU‑aligned labor laws formally protect unions, yet recent reforms and frequent union protests indicate a moderate, sometimes restrictive stance compared to stronger EU partners.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Serbia has undertaken substantial market‑reform measures—privatization, EU accession negotiations and liberal trade agreements—yet retains notable state intervention through subsidies, state‑owned enterprises and regulatory controls, indicating a moderate endorsement of free markets.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Serbia maintains a moderate welfare state with public health, pensions, and unemployment support, yet its political rhetoric emphasizes self‑reliance and economic reform, aligning it more closely with mixed‑market norms than with a staunch pro‑market position. Compared to other EU‑style welfare systems, Serbia shows a balanced stance that neither strongly opposes nor fully endorses the idea that welfare discourages responsibility.",0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Serbia operates a largely public health insurance system that covers nearly all citizens, yet it still permits private insurance and private providers. The government has not announced a comprehensive plan to eliminate private insurance; thus its stance is moderately supportive of public coverage but not fully pro‑public.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Serbia’s tax system is largely flat (10 % personal income tax, 15 % corporate tax) with no progressive brackets or wealth‑specific levies, so it does not endorse higher rates for the rich.",-0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Serbia maintains a relatively liberal corporate climate with low corporate taxes, pro‑investment legislation, and a relatively streamlined company registration process, but it retains significant state ownership in key sectors and imposes sector‑specific restrictions on foreign participation, positioning it modestly to the right of the compass.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Serbia keeps the bulk of essential utilities—electricity, gas, water, and rail—under state ownership or heavy regulation, with limited private participation, aligning moderately strongly with the statement.",0.65
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Serbia operates a mixed‑market economy with significant state involvement and a welfare component; while it acknowledges that capitalism can produce inequality and has experienced periods of instability, it does not view these outcomes as inevitable or as a mandate to abolish market mechanisms.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Serbia’s post‑1990 reforms have moved it toward a mixed‑market economy, with significant private‑sector R&D and innovation incentives, yet the state still retains control over major enterprises and key strategic sectors. Compared to global norms, this yields a moderately pro‑profit position that acknowledges state planning but largely favors profit‑driven innovation.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Serbia’s laws permit monitoring for national‑security purposes under judicial oversight and EU data‑protection standards, placing it modestly on the pro‑surveillance side of the global spectrum, though far from extreme.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Serbia allows some public criticism, but legal provisions (defamation penalties, licensing controls) and reported intimidation of journalists and activists impose tangible consequences, placing it below fully open societies but above highly restrictive regimes.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Serbia’s recent legal framework (e.g., the 2023 “Foreign Agents” law, expanded anti‑terror measures, and frequent restrictions on protests and independent media) demonstrates a clear emphasis on law and order even at the expense of certain civil liberties, aligning it moderately with the statement; however, it still maintains a functioning parliamentary democracy and EU‑aligned reforms, tempering the stance compared to outright authoritarian regimes.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Serbia’s governance has shown tendencies to consolidate power in the hands of President Aleksandar Vučić—through media control, weakened opposition and concerns over judicial independence—yet it still holds regular elections and maintains a parliamentary system, placing it moderately closer to the “strong leader” end than to a fully functioning democracy.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Serbia’s constitution permits referendums, yet the practice is rare and mainly confined to constitutional amendments; the political system operates predominantly through representative mechanisms, indicating a modestly negative alignment with the idea of direct decision‑making by referendums.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Serbia has enacted police‑reform laws that expand the authority of law‑enforcement agencies, particularly in combating organized crime and terrorism, reflecting a moderate pro‑police stance; however, EU monitoring reports highlight ongoing concerns about abuse and lack of full independence, preventing an extreme endorsement.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Serbia’s constitution guarantees freedom of assembly, but in practice the government often restricts or criminalizes protests that challenge its authority. Compared with liberal democracies that broadly endorse civil disobedience, Serbia’s stance is slightly negative, reflecting a cautious or suppressive approach to such activism.",-0.15

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Serbia’s constitutional guarantees of personal freedoms are undermined by documented media restrictions, limited press freedom, sporadic police crackdowns on dissent, and a rule‑of‑law record below EU averages. Compared with global democratic norms that uphold freedoms even during crises, Serbia leans toward allowing some sacrifices of personal liberties.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Serbia retains a legal requirement for military service for male citizens, yet the conscription system has been suspended and is not extended to women, placing its support for mandatory service at a moderate level but not fully universal.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Serbia’s constitution provides for public accountability (e.g., votes of no confidence, elections), yet in practice corruption remains high, rule‑of‑law weaknesses, and limited independent oversight diminish the effectiveness of such mechanisms. Compared to global averages, Serbia’s strict public accountability falls below neutral.",-0.3
