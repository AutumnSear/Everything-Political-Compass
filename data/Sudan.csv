Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Sudan’s tax structure (progressive income tax up to 30 % and a 15 % VAT) and limited social protection programs are modest, yet the informal economy, weak enforcement, and high inequality (Gini ≈ 42) indicate that wealth redistribution is not a major policy priority relative to global standards.",0.15
