Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Estonia maintains a flat‑tax, market‑oriented system with limited but universal social services; it views taxation as a tool for basic redistribution but does not endorse aggressive redistribution policy, placing it near the center‑pro position.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Estonia’s policy framework—high economic‑freedom rankings, low regulatory burden, strong support for SMEs, and an efficient digital public sector—reflects a clear preference for private‑sector efficiency, though it still maintains a modest welfare state.",0.6

Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Estonia’s flat tax, low corporate tax on distributed profits, and highly streamlined regulatory framework underscore a strong pro‑free‑market orientation, yet the state retains a comprehensive welfare system and EU‑mandated regulations that moderate an absolute laissez‑faire stance.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Estonia maintains a comparatively small welfare state—social spending is roughly 15 % of GDP, below the EU average—while promoting low taxes, a flat‑tax system, and entrepreneurial self‑reliance; this reflects a moderate view that welfare can dampen personal responsibility, though the country still provides universal health care and pensions.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Estonia operates a universal public health insurance system that covers all residents, yet it also permits private supplementary insurance; therefore, the country is moderately supportive of public provision but has not fully eliminated private insurers.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Estonia applies a flat personal income tax of 20 % (with a lower rate for the very lowest incomes) and no significant progressive wealth or inheritance taxes, indicating a preference for equal rates across income brackets rather than higher rates for the wealthy.

Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Estonia’s economic model combines a strong free‑market orientation (flat tax, low regulation, digital entrepreneurship) with modest welfare provisions, and its data show relatively low inequality (Gini ≈ 0.26) and high macro‑economic stability.

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Estonia consistently enforces rule‑of‑law principles and protects civil liberties, yet implements limited security‑related restrictions (e.g., anti‑terrorism, extremist propaganda laws).

Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Estonia’s political system relies mainly on representative democracy; it has held only a handful of national referendums (e.g., independence in 1991 and a constitutional amendment in 1992) and does not regularly use direct voting for most policy matters, indicating a moderate disagreement with the statement.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Estonia upholds a rule‑of‑law framework that balances police authority with civil liberties; while it grants standard law‑enforcement powers, it has not pursued major expansions to police powers beyond what is typical for democratic states.
