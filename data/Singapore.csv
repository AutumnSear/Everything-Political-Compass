Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Singapore adopts a pragmatic regulatory approach that aims to protect workers and consumers while maintaining a competitive, business-friendly environment; it enforces key labor, safety, and consumer laws but avoids blanket industry oversight. Compared globally, Singapore sits on the moderate side of the spectrum, favoring targeted regulation rather than sweeping controls.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Singapore adopts a pragmatic, market‑oriented approach that includes progressive taxation and targeted social safety nets such as the Central Provident Fund, Workfare, and subsidised housing, but it stops short of extensive wealth redistribution, favoring economic efficiency and meritocracy. Compared with other OECD countries, Singapore’s stance is moderately pro‑redistribution—supportive of basic redistribution mechanisms while maintaining low overall tax burdens and high economic competitiveness.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Singapore champions private sector efficiency and competitiveness, yet it maintains a robust state role in strategic industries, public housing, and social safety nets, reflecting a pragmatic blend rather than outright privatization.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Singapore endorses the role of labor unions within its tripartite industrial relations framework, viewing them as cooperative partners that help safeguard worker rights while maintaining a flexible and competitive workforce. This balanced, moderate stance is pro‑union relative to many global contexts but not as extreme as the most union‑centric societies.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Singapore’s economic model champions free trade, low corporate taxes, and minimal tariffs, ranking it among the world’s most open economies, yet it simultaneously retains strong state intervention through strategic SOEs, infrastructure planning, and regulatory oversight.  The country therefore supports free markets but also recognizes the need for targeted government action, placing it firmly on the pro‑market side but far from an extreme laissez‑faire stance.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Singapore’s social policy stresses personal savings through the CPF and targeted assistance such as the Workfare Income Supplement, reflecting a belief that broad welfare can dampen self‑reliance; however, it still maintains a modest safety net for seniors and the very poor, aligning with a moderate pro‑statement stance relative to global norms.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Singapore maintains a universal public healthcare system with strong subsidies and mandatory Medisave savings, yet it also permits and encourages private insurance and private providers, viewing them as complementary to public care; therefore it would oppose a blanket replacement of private insurance by public systems.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Singapore employs a progressive personal income tax system with a top marginal rate of 22%, but overall tax rates remain low to maintain economic competitiveness; the government supports modestly higher rates for high earners rather than extreme wealth taxation.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Singapore consistently promotes a business‑friendly climate, ranking first on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index and offering low corporate taxes, robust IP protection, and streamlined regulatory procedures, while still maintaining key oversight in areas such as competition, finance, and environmental standards. Its stance leans strongly toward minimizing constraints to spur growth, though it rejects absolute deregulation.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Singapore keeps essential utilities largely in state hands—water through PUB and electricity via SP PowerGrid—while allowing limited private participation, reflecting a moderate pro-public stance that is more state‑oriented than the global trend toward privatization.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Singapore champions a highly market‑driven economy while employing extensive state intervention—state‑owned enterprises, active industrial policy, and robust social safety nets—to curb inequality and social unrest. Thus, Singapore tends to view capitalism as potentially unequal but manageable, placing it slightly against the blanket claim that capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Singapore maintains a mixed economy, pairing strong state-led planning and public sector oversight with a highly pro‑business environment that encourages private profit‑driven R&D; it views both elements as complementary rather than mutually exclusive, so it would not endorse the view that profit‑driven innovation alone outperforms state planning.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Singapore consistently expands surveillance capabilities—such as extensive CCTV coverage, cyber‑monitoring under the Communications Security Act, and stringent anti‑terrorism laws—to safeguard national security, reflecting a policy that leans strongly toward state monitoring. Relative to global practices, Singapore sits above the median pro‑surveillance stance, but it is not at the most extreme pro‑surveillance end of the spectrum.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Singapore’s laws—such as the Sedition Act, POFMA and the use of court orders to limit “defamatory” speech—actively curtail unrestrained criticism of the government, reflecting a stance that prioritizes social stability over unrestricted free expression, unlike most liberal democracies.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Singapore’s governing policies and public statements consistently emphasize that maintaining stability and public order justifies restricting certain freedoms—such as limiting public assembly, enforcing strict defamation laws, and censoring the media—while still preserving other civil liberties, placing it more firmly on the law‑and‑order side than most liberal democracies but far from an extreme “total suspension” stance.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Singapore’s political narrative emphasizes strong, efficient governance and a merit‑based meritocracy, often citing the need for decisive leadership to sustain economic growth and social stability, yet it also maintains a controlled democratic system with periodic elections, a rule‑of‑law framework, and institutional checks, reflecting a moderate preference for strong leadership over a chaotic democracy.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Singapore’s government has historically limited the use of referendums, preferring elected parliamentary deliberation and expert decision‑making, and has only called a handful of nationwide plebiscites, indicating a cautious but not absolute opposition to direct democracy.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Singapore consistently prioritizes strong law‑and‑order measures and publicly supports expanding police powers to maintain its low crime rate, while still enforcing legal safeguards such as the Internal Security Act and court oversight. Compared with global trends, Singapore leans strongly in favor of enhanced police authority, but stops short of endorsing unchecked or extrajudicial powers.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Singapore’s government tightly regulates public protest, requiring permits under the Public Order Act and prosecuting dissenters under the Sedition Act; civil disobedience that violates these laws is usually deemed unlawful rather than a legitimate form of protest. This places Singapore at a moderately anti‑civil disobedience stance compared to more liberal global norms.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Singapore has consistently promoted strong government intervention to preserve social cohesion, exemplified by strict public order laws, the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, and the emphasis on multiracial unity in national policy—positioning it more pro‑state than most liberal democracies but less extreme than fully authoritarian regimes.",0.65
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Singapore routinely enacts emergency measures—such as mandatory quarantines, curfews, and strict public assembly laws—to safeguard public order and health, illustrating its willingness to curtail personal freedoms during crises; this contrasts with liberal democracies that often prioritize individual liberties even in emergencies. Globally, such an approach is viewed as moderately anti‑freedom, aligning with many authoritarian‑leaning regimes rather than the extreme pro‑freedom stance.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Singapore maintains a compulsory National Service for all male citizens and permanent residents, viewing it as essential for national security, while women are exempt, so the policy aligns with many militaristic nations but does not cover all citizens.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Singapore maintains a strong rule‑of‑law framework with robust anti‑corruption agencies and legal mechanisms to hold leaders accountable, yet its political system prioritises stability and meritocratic continuity, so public pressure seldom leads to immediate removal or punitive action.",0.3
