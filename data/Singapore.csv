Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Singapore balances a pro‑business framework with robust anti‑exploitation regulations—strict labour, anti‑corruption, and consumer‑protection laws coexist with a liberal economic policy—placing it modestly above neutral on a global scale.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Singapore maintains a modest progressive tax regime and provides extensive public services (housing, healthcare, CPF savings) that redistribute resources, yet its political philosophy prioritizes meritocracy and equal opportunity over aggressive wealth redistribution; therefore it views redistribution as helpful but not essential to reducing inequality.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Singapore promotes a pro‑business climate with low taxes, robust IP protection, and free trade, and it frequently cites private sector efficiency; however, it also maintains highly efficient state‑run enterprises and public services, reflecting a pragmatic view that both can be effective.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Singapore permits and regulates labor unions as part of its tripartite system, recognizing their role in safeguarding workers’ rights while emphasizing consensus‑driven negotiation with employers; its approach is supportive but not fully aligned with the strongest unionist perspectives.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Singapore champions a highly open, low‑tax, low‑regulation business environment, yet it also employs strategic state intervention through government‑linked companies, stringent regulatory oversight, and social welfare programs to correct market failures and promote long‑term stability.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Singapore’s social policy is relatively modest compared to many Western welfare states, stressing personal savings, workfare and self‑reliance; this suggests a moderate agreement that welfare can dampen individual responsibility, placing it slightly right of center.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,Singapore maintains a mixed health system: the government funds public hospitals and mandatory basic insurance (MediShield) while private insurance remains available and is encouraged as supplemental coverage. Thus Singapore does not support a full replacement of private insurers.,0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Singapore’s tax system is modestly progressive, with higher marginal rates for the wealthy and a social safety net, but overall rates and social spending are comparatively low, indicating a moderate alignment with the statement.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Singapore consistently ranks among the world’s most business‑friendly economies, offering low corporate taxes and streamlined licensing, yet it maintains robust regulatory oversight in finance, competition, and environmental matters. Thus, it supports relatively minimal restrictions while preserving key safeguards.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Singapore maintains public ownership of key utilities such as water (PUB) and electricity (SP Group), and emphasizes state control over essential services while allowing limited market participation; thus it strongly agrees with keeping these services public.",0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Singapore supports a market economy but relies on robust state intervention to mitigate inequality and ensure social stability, so it would largely disagree that capitalism inevitably causes such problems.",-0.5

Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Singapore’s legal framework, including the Sedition Act and strict defamation laws, heavily restricts free expression; its press‑freedom rankings confirm a tightly controlled environment that limits criticism of the government, placing it far below global free‑speech norms.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Singapore consistently prioritizes law and order, using strict legislation and controls over speech, assembly, and political opposition, which indicates a strong agreement with the idea that order can justify limiting some freedoms.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Singapore’s political culture prizes strong, decisive leadership and a stable, merit‑based administration, and its dominant PAP party often argues that such leadership yields more efficient governance than a fragmented, “messy” democracy, yet the country retains formal democratic institutions, elections, and a constitution.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Singapore operates a parliamentary system dominated by the PAP, and only constitutional amendments have ever been put to a public vote; ordinary policy decisions are made by elected representatives. Thus, it strongly opposes the notion that most issues should be decided through referendums, aligning with a near‑maximum anti‑direct‑democracy position.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Singapore's legal framework and political culture prioritize strict law enforcement and public order, granting police broad authority and supporting expanded powers to curb crime.

Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Singapore’s constitution and policies emphasize strong state control over many aspects of life to preserve social harmony, evident in strict public order laws, extensive social planning, and ethnic quotas; globally, such measures position it far to the right of the scale on the necessity of authority.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Singapore’s constitution authorises the state to suspend personal freedoms during emergencies, and the government routinely employs strict controls on expression and assembly—contrasting with liberal democracies that largely preserve such liberties. Consequently, Singapore aligns more with a center‑anti position on the statement.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Singapore requires compulsory national service for all male citizens (and second‑generation male permanent residents) but does not impose it on female citizens, so the country only partially aligns with the universal mandate.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Singapore places emphasis on legal and institutional checks—such as the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and the Constitution—rather than on direct public scrutiny; press freedom and civic participation are limited, so leaders are not typically held strictly accountable by the public.",-0.25
