Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Israel maintains a progressive income tax system with a top marginal rate of about 50 % and spends roughly 10 % of GDP on social welfare programs, showing moderate support for redistribution while still favoring a market‑oriented economy.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Israel’s economic policy has leaned toward market‑oriented reforms—evidenced by the privatization of Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, the telecom sector, and the extensive use of private contractors in defense—but it also retains a sizable public sector in health, education, and welfare, reflecting a balanced view rather than outright endorsement of pure privatization.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Israel has a long history of strong labor unions, especially within the Histadrut, which once represented roughly 40 % of the workforce and shaped labor policy, yet recent governments have relaxed union influence and membership has fallen.

Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Israel has embraced extensive market liberalization since the 1980s, fostering a robust high‑tech startup sector and encouraging foreign investment, yet it retains significant state involvement in defense, strategic industries, and social welfare, placing it above average support for free markets but below the extreme laissez‑faire stance seen in some Western and Asian economies.",0.45

Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Israel has pursued a pro‑business agenda through low corporate taxes, investment incentives, and an active venture‑capital ecosystem, reflecting a preference for minimal regulatory constraints while still enforcing competition, antitrust, and data‑protection laws.

Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Israel’s economy is largely driven by a free‑market model that encourages high‑tech entrepreneurship, foreign investment and open trade, while the state maintains key sectors such as defense, water, and social welfare; thus, it rejects the idea that capitalism inherently causes inequality or instability and instead sees regulation as a means to mitigate those risks.",-0.75

Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Israel is a parliamentary democracy that has historically elected decisive leaders such as David Ben‑Gurion and Benjamin Netanyahu, yet it maintains robust institutional checks and balances and participates in global democratic norms, indicating a moderate pro‑strong‑leader stance relative to worldwide politics.",0.3

Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Israel emphasizes government authority for national security and social cohesion, as seen in compulsory military service, centralized civil defense coordination, and state‑led policies on immigration and religious law, while still upholding a democratic system with free elections and civil liberties. Compared globally, this reflects a moderately pro‑government stance—stronger than most liberal democracies but less authoritarian than highly centralized states.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Israel has repeatedly enacted emergency regulations that temporarily curtail personal freedoms—such as curfews, restrictions on movement in the West Bank, and administrative detention—while maintaining a democratic legal framework; these actions demonstrate that the country sees the blanket protection of freedoms as unrealistic in crises.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Israel requires compulsory military service for almost all citizens—men serve 27 months, women 24 months—with a few exemptions (e.g., religious scholars, health issues).
