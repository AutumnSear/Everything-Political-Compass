Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Trinidad and Tobago enforces substantial regulation in its petroleum, labor, and utility sectors to guard against exploitation, yet preserves a largely market‑oriented economy in other areas, positioning it modestly on the pro‑regulation side of the global scale.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Trinidad and Tobago operates a moderately progressive income‑tax system and a modest welfare network, reflecting a pragmatic endorsement of redistribution, though less expansive than many European social‑democratic models.

Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Trinidad and Tobago runs a mixed‑market economy that heavily relies on private sector activity while maintaining state‑run enterprises in key sectors; its history of privatization, liberal trade policies, and support for private enterprise indicates a pragmatic view that private firms are generally more efficient than government programs, though it remains cautious about core utilities.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Trinidad and Tobago has a long tradition of strong union activity supported by comprehensive labor laws (e.g., Trade Union Act, Minimum Wage Act, Workers’ Compensation Act), a high union density, and a government that routinely consults unions on policy.

Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Trinidad and Tobago operates a largely market‑oriented economy with active private sector participation, but it retains significant state ownership and regulatory oversight in key industries such as oil, gas, and utilities—placing it only slightly on the pro‑free‑market side compared to global norms.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Trinidad and Tobago maintains a mixed‑market system with universal healthcare, free primary and secondary education, and a sizable social assistance network, indicating a pragmatic policy approach that values welfare rather than discouraging individual responsibility.

Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Trinidad and Tobago operates a mixed‑market economy with significant state involvement in key sectors such as oil and gas, yet it has pursued liberal reforms, lowered corporate tax relative to regional peers, and adopted standard regulatory frameworks that allow private enterprise to thrive.

Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Trinidad and Tobago’s economy is largely market‑driven yet supplemented by significant state‑run welfare programs; the government’s pragmatic stance toward regulating markets to curb inequality suggests a modestly pro‑capitalist view, thus it would likely disagree with the inevitability claim.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Trinidad and Tobago’s economy combines significant private sector activity with notable state planning—evidenced by state‑owned utilities, a national development plan, and government‑backed innovation initiatives—so it views profit‑driven innovation as beneficial but still values state guidance; this places it modestly to the right of the global median.",0.25

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Trinidad and Tobago enforces strict anti‑crime and anti‑drug laws with significant police powers, yet maintains constitutional civil liberties, placing it moderately right‑leaning on the law‑and‑order axis compared to global norms.",0.3

Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Trinidad and Tobago has constitutional provisions for parliamentary oversight, a public service commission, and an anti‑corruption agency, indicating a moderate institutional emphasis on leader accountability, but its 2022 Transparency International ranking (71/180) and occasional politicized enforcement suggest the stance is slightly pro‑accountability rather than strongly anti‑ or ultra‑pro.",0.2
