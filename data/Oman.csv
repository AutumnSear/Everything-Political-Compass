Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Oman employs state regulation primarily in its key oil and gas sectors and maintains regulatory bodies for labor and environmental standards, while largely liberalizing other industries—placing it moderately in favor of regulation compared to global norms.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Oman operates a modest welfare system (free healthcare, pensions) and has recently introduced a low‑rate VAT, but it relies largely on oil revenues and maintains a relatively flat tax regime with limited progressive redistribution, making it neither strongly pro nor strongly anti wealth‑redistribution.",0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Oman has introduced reforms such as free‑trade zones and incentives for foreign investment, signalling a belief that the private sector can be more efficient, yet it continues to maintain state control over key utilities and strategic industries, reflecting a moderate pro‑private stance rather than a full endorsement.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Oman permits union registration under the Ministry of Labour, but the union structure is tightly state‑controlled and independent collective bargaining is limited; while legal recognition exists, low density and weak enforcement mean Oman is only moderately pro‑union relative to global norms.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Oman retains substantial state ownership and regulation in key sectors (oil, telecom, shipping) and employs protective measures such as subsidies and local‑content requirements, indicating a preference for state‑guided markets over laissez‑faire; therefore it largely disagrees with the assertion that unregulated markets benefit everyone.",-0.58
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Oman maintains significant welfare subsidies (fuel, food, public sector employment) that can dampen incentives for self‑reliance, yet it simultaneously pursues Omanization and private‑sector promotion, reflecting a moderate but slightly pro‑statement position.",0.28
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Oman operates a largely public health system that offers free or heavily subsidized care to citizens, yet it also relies on private insurance—particularly for expatriates—and maintains a small private hospital sector. This mixed model shows a moderate pro‑public stance without a full replacement of private insurers.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Oman does not impose personal income tax and applies only a flat 5 % VAT, so it lacks any progressive tax mechanism that would require the wealthy to pay higher rates. Relative to global norms where most countries tax higher incomes at higher rates, Oman’s fiscal policy is strongly opposed to the statement, placing it firmly on the left‑negative side of the scale.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Oman promotes private sector growth through reforms and a 15 % corporate tax, yet maintains significant state control and regulatory burdens, positioning it moderately to the right of the center on the universal political compass.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Oman’s electricity, water, and other basic utilities are operated by state‑owned companies, and the government has not pursued large‑scale privatization of these services; this aligns Oman with the view that essential utilities should stay public, although it does allow private participation in other sectors.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Oman operates a moderately free‑market economy with significant state involvement and welfare measures; it views capitalism as largely beneficial but acknowledges that unchecked capitalism can generate inequality, yet it generally does not endorse the claim that capitalism inevitably leads to instability.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Oman pursues a state‑led development model—its Vision 2040 and numerous state‑owned enterprises underscore substantial government planning—yet it also promotes private sector growth and innovation, placing it slightly more on the state‑planning side than on pure profit‑driven innovation.",-0.1
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Oman’s legal framework permits state monitoring of communications under national‑security provisions, a stance common among Gulf monarchies but lacking robust oversight mechanisms that characterize more liberal democracies. This places Oman in the moderate‑pro surveillance camp relative to global norms.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Oman’s constitution allows limited freedom of expression, but its laws criminalize criticism of the government, and the press is tightly controlled; the country scores very low on global freedom‑of‑speech indices, indicating a strong restriction on open dissent.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Oman’s constitutional monarchy places strong emphasis on maintaining social stability, consistently restricting political dissent, press freedom, and public assembly to preserve law and order; this pragmatic approach aligns closely with the statement, though it is less extreme than totalitarian regimes and still offers limited civil liberties.",0.65
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Oman operates under an absolute monarchy where the Sultan holds decisive executive power; it lacks the pluralistic institutions and frequent electoral contests that typify a “messy democracy.” Compared with global norms, Oman’s governance favors strong centralized authority over democratic pluralism, placing it on the pro‑strong‑leader side of the compass.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Oman is an absolute monarchy with an appointed Consultative Council and no use of referendums for major policy decisions; its governance structure places it far from supporting direct popular decision‑making, unlike most democratic systems worldwide.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Oman’s security regime grants the Royal Oman Police broad authority, reflecting a moderate to strong endorsement of police power to manage crime; this aligns with a conservative position on law‑enforcement authority compared to global norms.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,Oman’s political system is an absolute monarchy that strictly regulates public assembly and expression; civil disobedience is viewed as unlawful and is not accepted as a legitimate protest method.,-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Oman operates under an absolute monarchy that exercises significant authority to maintain stability and social cohesion, evidenced by its centralized governance, tribal integration policies, and strong state role in public life; this aligns strongly with the belief that government authority is essential for social cohesion. While not a fully welfare‑state system, Oman's reliance on state control for cohesion places it well above neutral on the scale.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Oman restricts key personal freedoms such as free expression, press, and political assembly, indicating a moderate disagreement with the absolute claim that freedoms must never be sacrificed—even in crises.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Oman’s armed forces are largely volunteer‑based, with no universal conscription law; only a limited, optional national service exists, so Oman would strongly disagree with mandatory service for all citizens.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Oman operates as an absolute monarchy where the Sultan holds extensive executive power; public mechanisms for holding leaders strictly accountable—such as a free press, independent judiciary, or robust parliamentary oversight—are limited, placing Oman far from endorsing stringent public accountability.",-0.8
