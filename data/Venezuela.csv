Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Venezuela has pursued a historically state‑led economic model since the late 1990s, nationalizing key industries, limiting private enterprise, and repeatedly prioritizing government programs over market solutions; its record of high inflation, shortages, and inefficient state operations further undermines the claim that private businesses are inherently more efficient.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Venezuela’s Bolivarian regime historically promotes labor unions as key instruments of its socialist agenda, supporting collective bargaining and state‑aligned unions, though it tightly controls independent union activity—indicating a moderate to strong endorsement of unions for workers’ rights.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Venezuela’s current regime has repeatedly nationalized key industries, imposed strict price and currency controls, and restricted private enterprise, indicating a clear opposition to laissez‑faire free markets.
