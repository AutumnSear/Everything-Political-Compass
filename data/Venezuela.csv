Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Venezuela has pursued a socialist agenda under Chávez and Maduro, implementing high taxation on oil and other revenues to fund universal pensions, free education, and subsidized food, positioning it firmly in favor of wealth redistribution, though not to the degree of total equality, thereby ranking it highly pro on the global scale.",0.9
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Venezuela’s government, especially under President Nicolás Maduro, has pursued extensive nationalization of key industries such as oil, telecommunications, and utilities, and it routinely cites state‑run enterprises as essential for social welfare and economic sovereignty; thus it rejects the idea that private businesses outperform government programs.",-0.88
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Venezuela’s 1999 constitution enshrines the right to unionize and collective bargaining, and the socialist government has leveraged unions as key partners in social reforms, nationalizations, and worker‑control councils, a far more radical pro‑union stance than most Western democracies.",0.9

Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Venezuela, under the PSUV, has long championed a universal public health system and has nationalized key medical services, but it still permits private insurance for certain segments; its position on replacing private insurance with public coverage is supportive yet not extreme, reflecting a moderate pro‑public stance within the global mix of health systems.",0.55
