Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Colombia enforces a mix of labor, antitrust, and environmental regulations that protect workers and the public, yet it largely adopts a market‑oriented, free‑trade stance, limiting heavy regulation across all industries.",0.42
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Colombia implements moderately progressive income taxes and a range of social programs that redistribute wealth, but its tax rates and social spending are below those of high‑redistribution OECD countries, reflecting a centrist‑to‑center‑pro stance on taxation for inequality reduction.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Colombia has historically pursued a mixed‑market model with significant privatization and liberalization reforms, yet recent administrations have increased state involvement in key sectors. This places the country slightly pro‑private enterprise, but not strongly, resulting in a modest positive stance toward the claim.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Colombia’s constitution guarantees freedom of association and collective bargaining, and its labor laws maintain union protections, but recent reforms have increased market flexibility and union density remains low, giving it a moderate pro‑union position.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Colombia has pursued liberal trade agreements, privatization, and market‑friendly reforms since the 1990s, indicating a general pro‑market orientation. However, the country also maintains substantial regulation, social safety nets, and state involvement in key sectors—suggesting a moderate endorsement of free markets but with significant caveats.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Colombia’s welfare system—characterized by conditional cash transfers (Plan Familias), universal health coverage, and a contributory pension scheme—seeks to encourage responsibility (e.g., school attendance, health check‑ups) rather than disincentivize work. Compared with more expansive welfare states (EU, UK) and market‑oriented states (USA, Chile), Colombia sits in the middle, leaning toward a moderate view that welfare can foster rather than undermine individual responsibility.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Colombia runs a mixed health system where universal public coverage coexists with private insurance companies that are regulated but not eliminated, so it does not support fully replacing private insurers with a public monopoly.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Colombia employs a progressive income tax with a top marginal rate of 33%, which means the wealthy pay higher rates than lower‑income earners; however, the rate is moderate relative to many OECD and welfare‑state countries, indicating a general but not extreme progressive stance.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Colombia has embraced market‑friendly reforms and free‑trade agreements, but still retains notable regulatory and tax burdens and state control in key sectors, placing it in a moderately pro‑liberal stance rather than an extreme minimal‑restriction approach.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Colombia has adopted a mixed‑market approach to utilities, with significant private participation in electricity, water and telecommunications while maintaining state‑owned entities (e.g., EPM) in key sectors. This pattern places it modestly toward privatization, but it still retains public ownership of essential services, reflecting a stance that is neither fully pro‑public nor fully anti‑public.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Colombia pursues a mixed‑market economy with free‑trade agreements and privatization while also running social welfare programs aimed at reducing inequality, reflecting a preference for capitalism and a rejection of the idea that capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Colombia operates a mixed economy with substantial state planning—evidenced by national development plans, state-owned enterprises in key sectors, and government‑funded R&D programs—while also encouraging private profit‑driven innovation through tax incentives and investment promotion. This mix tilts it modestly toward state planning rather than a fully profit‑centric stance.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Colombia’s constitution permits surveillance for national security, and Congress enacted Law 1719 (2013) expanding intelligence‑agency monitoring of communications to combat terrorism and drug trafficking; the state exercises these powers in targeted counter‑security operations. Compared to global norms, Colombia is moderately supportive of security‑driven surveillance, but it stops short of blanket monitoring.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Colombia’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression and it scores highly on global press‑freedom and civil‑liberties indices, though occasional security laws and incidents of intimidation against critics exist, indicating a largely supportive but not absolute stance.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Colombia’s legal and security framework has repeatedly emphasized law‑and‑order—through broad anti‑terrorism statutes, large‑scale policing initiatives, and historical anti‑drug campaigns—yet its constitutional guarantees and active civil society constrain a full suspension of individual liberties, placing it only moderately on the pro‑law‑and‑order side of the spectrum.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Colombia upholds a constitution that separates powers and regularly conducts free elections, indicating a preference for democratic governance over authoritarian strong‑leader models. Although some presidents have been popular for their decisive security policies, the institutional framework and public support for democratic checks remain the norm.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Colombia’s 1991 constitution allows referendums only in limited circumstances, and the country has historically relied on a representative democracy with few nationwide votes on major policy issues.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Colombia has consistently increased police authority through laws, budget allocations, and operational reforms to curb drug trafficking and organized crime, yet retains constitutional oversight and civil society scrutiny—placing it modestly pro‑police on the global spectrum.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Colombia’s 1991 constitution guarantees freedom of expression and assembly, and the country has a long history of social movements that rely on civil disobedience. While the state has occasionally suppressed protests, the legal framework and overall practice align with the view that civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Colombia’s strong central role in security, peace processes, and social welfare programs—alongside a mixed‑market economy—indicates a moderate, pro‑government stance on using state authority to preserve social cohesion.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Colombia’s 1991 Constitution explicitly permits temporary, proportionate restrictions on civil and political rights during declared emergencies, and the country has historically enacted measures—such as anti‑narcotics detentions, the 2015 peace‑process transitional justice provisions, and COVID‑19 lockdowns—that curtailed personal freedoms for security or public health reasons. This practice aligns with the common global pattern that allows some flexibility in crises, meaning Colombia would not fully endorse the absolute claim that personal freedoms should never be sacrificed.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Colombia enforces a 12‑month compulsory military service for male citizens aged 18‑24, while women may volunteer; this partial conscription aligns it moderately with the idea of mandatory service but falls short of the “all citizens” requirement. Compared to many OECD and EU countries that have abolished conscription, Colombia remains closer to traditional compulsory regimes such as South Korea or Israel, giving it a moderately positive stance.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Colombia has formal accountability mechanisms and a legal framework that supports public scrutiny, but enforcement and public demand are less robust than in many high‑corruption‑reduction regimes, placing it in the moderate‑supporting range.",0.32
