Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Sri Lanka enforces regulations in key sectors (banking, telecom, environmental protection) to curb exploitation, yet it has pursued market‑friendly reforms and liberalisation in recent years; its stance is therefore moderately left‑leaning rather than fully interventionist.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Sri Lanka has a progressive income tax structure and a modest social‑welfare framework, indicating a pragmatic belief that taxation can help curb inequality, though limited tax compliance and fiscal pressures reduce the overall redistributive effect compared with stronger welfare states.",0.32
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Sri Lanka’s recent economic reforms and privatization moves suggest a modest preference for private‑sector efficiency, yet the state still runs many key industries; compared to more liberal economies the country remains somewhat government‑heavy, placing it only slightly pro‑private.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Sri Lanka’s constitution and labor legislation formally recognize the right to unionize and collective bargaining, and trade unions play a prominent role in industrial relations, indicating a pro‑union stance comparable to many mixed‑market democracies.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Sri Lanka has a long history of state‑led economic planning, protective tariffs, subsidies and a large public‑sector presence, with only moderate market liberalisation in recent years. This practical, interventionist approach contrasts with the fully laissez‑faire view that free markets alone benefit everyone, placing Sri Lanka on the left‑leaning side of the statement.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Sri Lanka’s extensive state‑run welfare programs—free education, universal health coverage, subsidised food and energy, pension schemes, and social assistance—indicate a policy preference that welfare is essential for social stability; the government does not advocate that such programs discourage individual responsibility. Compared with global norms, Sri Lanka leans left‑wards on this issue.",-0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Sri Lanka operates a universal public health system that delivers the majority of care free at the point of use, leaving only a small private insurance market. The government has no active policy to eliminate private insurers, but the dominant public provision aligns with the statement.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Sri Lanka’s tax structure is progressive, with top marginal rates around 30% versus lower rates for the poor, but the overall tax burden and rate differential are modest compared to many developed nations, indicating a moderate agreement with the statement.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,Sri Lanka’s corporate environment is historically regulated with significant state involvement and bureaucratic barriers—especially in key sectors—so it does not align with the idea of minimal restrictions; recent reforms are limited.,-0.55
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Sri Lanka’s major utilities—electricity (Ceylon Electricity Board), water supply (Ceylon Water Supply Board), and the bulk of telecommunications—remain predominantly state‑owned, with the government retaining controlling stakes and subsidizing tariffs to keep services affordable.  While some sectors (e.g., telecom) have undergone partial privatization, the overall policy framework and recent reforms still emphasize public ownership of essential services, reflecting a moderate pro‑public stance relative to global norms.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Sri Lanka’s recent economic crisis and high inequality have reinforced a view that unchecked capitalism can breed instability, yet the country still pursues market‑based reforms and a mixed‑economy model. Compared with global norms, Sri Lanka moderately agrees that capitalism contributes to inequality and instability but does not see it as an unavoidable outcome.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Sri Lanka’s economic history is dominated by state‑led planning and large public enterprises, though recent reforms have sought to boost private innovation; overall the state still plays a more prominent role than the private sector, indicating a modest left‑leaning bias.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Sri Lanka’s legal framework (e.g., the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Cyber Crimes Act, and national security legislation) and its historical use of surveillance against dissent and media reflect a willingness to employ monitoring when justified by national security. Compared to global norms, this places Sri Lanka in the moderately pro‑surveillance, centre‑right range.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Sri Lanka maintains criminal defamation and sedition statutes and scores poorly on global press‑freedom indices, signalling that criticism can attract legal or administrative sanctions. However, the regime has not fully criminalized dissent, leaving some room for public critique.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Sri Lanka has a history of employing emergency powers, anti‑terrorism statutes, and security measures that have curtailed civil liberties, indicating a tendency to prioritize law and order even when some freedoms are restricted. While democratic institutions exist, the legal framework and past governance practices align more with a pro‑law‑and‑order stance than with a strict commitment to individual liberties.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Sri Lanka’s constitution and recent amendments favor a powerful executive, and leaders such as Mahinda Rajapaksa have exemplified strong‑leader governance, yet the country still conducts regular elections, maintains a multi‑party parliament and has some judicial and civil‑society checks, indicating a moderately mixed stance rather than outright endorsement of autocracy.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Sri Lanka’s constitutional framework and political practice rely primarily on representative parliamentary decision‑making, with referendums used only sparingly for rare constitutional changes; thus it does not endorse the view that most issues should be decided by direct public vote.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Sri Lanka’s laws (e.g., the Prevention of Terrorism Act and recent Police Act amendments) grant the police broad powers for detention, surveillance and force, reflecting a tendency to favor stronger law‑enforcement authority compared to many OECD democracies. This practical emphasis on police empowerment in response to crime and insurgency places Sri Lanka slightly above global centrism on the authority‑scale.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Sri Lanka’s constitution and penal code classify civil disobedience as unlawful, and the 2022 economic‑crisis protests were met with police and armed‑force crackdowns that led to arrests and violence, reflecting a state stance that does not view civil disobedience as legitimate.",-0.6
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Sri Lanka’s post‑civil‑war governance—marked by extensive emergency powers, central control of security forces, and legislation aimed at ethnic reconciliation—shows a clear reliance on strong state authority to preserve social cohesion, placing it moderately to the pro‑authoritarian side of the global spectrum.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Sri Lanka’s constitutional framework and emergency legislation—particularly the 1978 constitution’s executive powers, anti‑terrorism acts used during the civil war, and 2022 economic‑crisis laws allowing suspension of civil liberties—demonstrate a willingness to curtail personal freedoms in crises, aligning with a moderately anti‑freedom stance relative to global democratic norms.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Sri Lanka maintains a National Service scheme that requires basic military training for male citizens aged 18‑23, but it does not extend to women and the program has been largely suspended, indicating only partial alignment with the idea of universal mandatory service.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Sri Lanka has mechanisms for public accountability and has seen leaders resign under pressure, but persistent corruption, limited judicial independence, and weak enforcement of anti‑corruption laws dampen the overall strictness of public accountability compared to global norms.",0.2
