Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"PNG has enacted regulatory frameworks for mining and forestry, yet widespread enforcement gaps and corruption indicate the government does not fully implement heavy regulation, positioning it moderately pro‑regulation compared to global norms.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Papua New Guinea maintains a relatively low tax burden and limited social welfare programs; although its constitution calls for equitable distribution, its actual tax‑based redistribution is modest compared to OECD peers, indicating a moderate support for the statement.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"PNG’s mixed‑market policies stress private sector growth and view many state‑run enterprises as less efficient, yet the government still retains a regulatory and service‑delivery role, yielding a moderately pro‑private stance.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"PNG’s Labor Act and ratification of ILO conventions 87 and 98 formally recognize union rights and collective bargaining, indicating a moderate pro‑union stance; however, low union density, informal employment, and occasional enforcement gaps temper its practical commitment.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Papua New Guinea operates a mixed‑economy system with significant state involvement in key sectors (mining, infrastructure, and social services) and regulatory measures designed to protect local industry and manage resource revenue. While it participates in trade liberalization agreements, its domestic policies—such as local content requirements, state‑owned enterprises, and high regulation reflected in World Bank Doing Business rankings—indicate a moderate skepticism toward fully unregulated free markets. Hence its stance is slightly pro‑free market but not strongly so.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Papua New Guinea maintains a limited welfare system focused on essential social security for vulnerable groups, but it generally views such assistance as a necessary response to widespread poverty rather than a deterrent to personal initiative. The government’s policy emphasis leans toward community support and aid-driven development, suggesting modest disagreement with the claim that welfare discourages individual responsibility.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Papua New Guinea operates a fragmented, mixed health system with limited public coverage and no policy to eliminate private insurance; its stance on replacing private insurers with a fully public system is therefore neutral, aligning with the broader pattern of low‑to‑middle income countries that maintain both public and private provision.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"PNG’s tax legislation contains progressive income brackets, but the top marginal rates are modest and tax compliance is low, placing the country on the moderate side of progressive taxation compared to many OECD nations.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"PNG promotes foreign investment and resource development, yet imposes substantial regulatory oversight—particularly in mining and petroleum sectors—placing it right of center but not fully laissez‑faire.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"PNG’s electricity and water services are predominantly state‑run (e.g., PNG Power Corporation and municipal water boards), and the government promotes public ownership of essential utilities, but it also allows limited private sector participation and has pursued partial privatizations, positioning PNG modestly to the left of center on the public‑ownership spectrum.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"PNG’s political and economic system is predominantly free‑market oriented, with significant state involvement in resource regulation and social programs, reflecting a pragmatic view that capitalism can drive growth while also acknowledging its potential to generate inequality and instability.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"PNG’s economic framework blends significant state involvement in key resource sectors and national development planning with a modest private sector, and its low innovation metrics indicate limited confidence that profit‑driven innovation alone can drive societal benefit.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Papua New Guinea has enacted security legislation (e.g., the Intelligence and Security Act 2012) that authorizes the government to monitor communications to safeguard national security, indicating a pro‑surveillance orientation that aligns with many governments that prioritize security over privacy. While enforcement is hampered by limited resources and oversight, the legal framework and government rhetoric clearly support surveillance when justified by security concerns, placing PNG toward the center‑pro side of the universal political compass.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Papua New Guinea’s constitution nominally protects freedom of expression, but in practice criticism of the government often triggers criminal defamation or sedition proceedings, licensing restrictions on media, and occasional arrests or intimidation of journalists, indicating a moderate‑anti stance on unfettered critique relative to global norms.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Papua New Guinea’s constitution and democratic institutions largely safeguard civil liberties, and while the government occasionally imposes temporary restrictions for stability (e.g., during riots or security alerts), such measures are not systemic. Thus, PNG sits just slightly to the right of the center on the authoritarian dimension, prioritizing law and order but without pervasive suppression of freedoms.",0.1
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Papua New Guinea functions as a parliamentary democracy with regular elections, an independent judiciary, and anti‑corruption initiatives, indicating a general preference for democratic governance; however, frequent political instability and reliance on local strongmen suggest a mild tolerance for concentrated leadership, yielding a slightly negative stance.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Papua New Guinea’s constitution permits referendums only for constitutional amendments and has not employed them for major policy decisions; governance is primarily parliamentary, with elected representatives making most decisions.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Papua New Guinea has enacted reforms that grant the police expanded powers to tackle crime, reflecting a moderate endorsement of greater police authority; however, ongoing concerns about accountability and misuse keep the position from being strongly pro‑police.",0.32
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Papua New Guinea’s constitution guarantees peaceful assembly but its courts and law‑enforcement agencies routinely treat acts of civil disobedience—particularly those that disrupt public order—as unlawful, reflecting a cautious, moderate stance that tolerates protest but does not officially endorse it as a legitimate tool for social change.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Papua New Guinea’s mixed constitutional monarchy and strong tradition of tribal and local governance mean it relies on central authority to enforce law and quell ethnic conflict, but its weak institutions and emphasis on provincial autonomy keep its support for government control moderate relative to highly centralized states.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Papua New Guinea’s constitution guarantees civil liberties, yet the government has repeatedly invoked emergency powers—such as during unrest and the COVID‑19 pandemic—to impose movement restrictions and curtail public gatherings. Compared with liberal democracies that largely resist such curtailments, PNG’s willingness to limit freedoms in crises places it modestly below the centrist point on the scale.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Papua New Guinea has no conscription law; the armed forces are staffed by volunteers, reflecting a policy that opposes mandatory service.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Papua New Guinea has constitutional and statutory provisions (e.g., the Public Service Act and the Anti‑Corruption Act) and institutions such as an Ombudsman and a Public Complaints Committee that theoretically support public accountability. In practice, enforcement is often weak, corruption remains widespread, and leaders can retain power despite public criticism, so the country aligns moderately with the statement but not strongly.",0.3
