Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"The Bahamas maintains a moderate regulatory framework—particularly in its offshore financial sector and labor market—but overall it favors market liberalism and does not impose heavy regulation across all industries, resulting in a somewhat pro‑regulation stance but not a strong one.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"The Bahamas operates a largely flat, low‑tax regime—no income or capital gains taxes and minimal progressive levies—while funding public services primarily through payroll taxes, business taxes, and import duties. Compared with global norms where progressive taxation is viewed as key to reducing inequality, the Bahamas’ evidence shows a markedly less redistribution‑oriented stance.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"The Bahamas operates a highly liberal market economy, with low corporate taxation, a strong emphasis on tourism and financial services, and a history of privatizing many utilities and infrastructure projects. While it maintains public health and education services, its overall policy framework and business environment strongly favor private enterprise efficiency, placing it moderately to the pro‑private side of the scale.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"The Bahamas enshrines union rights in its Labour Relations Act and maintains an active union center that regularly engages in collective bargaining, indicating a recognition of unions as a tool to protect workers. Nonetheless, the country’s relatively low union density and the significant influence of private employers suggest a moderate, not fully pro‑union, position on the universal political compass.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"The Bahamas maintains a highly liberalized economy with low taxes and a free‑trade zone, but it also intervenes to provide state services, social safety nets, and climate‑adaptation measures, indicating a moderate endorsement of free markets tempered by pragmatic state role.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"The Bahamas operates a modest welfare system that includes universal healthcare and a social security pension scheme, yet its overall social‑protection spending is only about 6% of GDP, reflecting a pragmatic mix of market and state roles. This moderate approach indicates the government does not strongly endorse the view that welfare necessarily undermines personal responsibility, placing its stance slightly to the left of the statement.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Bahamas offers a public healthcare system and a national insurance scheme, yet it still maintains a substantial private insurance sector and has not pursued a single‑payer model that would eliminate private insurers. This places the country in a mixed‑market position, slightly leaning away from a complete public replacement of private insurance.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"The Bahamas operates a largely flat‑rate, low‑tax regime with no income, capital gains, or progressive tax system, relying instead on indirect taxes such as VAT; therefore it is unlikely to support significantly higher tax rates for the wealthy.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"The Bahamas maintains a highly business‑friendly environment, with zero corporate tax for foreign‑owned entities and streamlined licensing, reflecting a strong pro‑growth stance that aligns closely with the statement; however, it still enforces regulatory compliance (FATF, AML, and certain local restrictions) that slightly temper a purely minimal‑restriction approach.",0.8
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"The Bahamas operates most essential utilities—electricity (BNEC), water (BWSA), and telecommunications (BHTC)—as state‑owned enterprises or agencies, reflecting a policy preference for keeping such services publicly managed. This aligns with a moderate pro‑public‑ownership stance relative to global norms.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"The Bahamas operates a largely market‑oriented economy with strong pro‑capitalist policies (tourism, banking, free trade) yet implements modest social programs; it tends to view inequality as a manageable issue rather than an inevitable outcome of capitalism. Compared to global averages, the Bahamas leans slightly pro‑capitalism, so it would largely disagree with the claim that capitalism inevitably causes inequality and instability.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"The Bahamas operates an open, market‑driven economy with minimal state planning, relying on private sector innovation and investment incentives (e.g., no income tax, tax‑free zones). This aligns strongly with the view that profit‑driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"The Bahamas has enacted data‑retention and surveillance provisions under its Telecommunications and anti‑money‑laundering laws to aid law‑enforcement, yet its constitutional protections and modest democratic apparatus temper over‑reach, placing it modestly above neutral but well below an extreme pro‑surveillance stance.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"The Bahamas’ constitution guarantees freedom of expression and the press, and the media routinely critique the government; while defamation provisions exist, they are not routinely used to suppress criticism, placing the country well above global average on free‑speech metrics.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"The Bahamas enforces a robust legal framework to protect its tourism-driven economy and maintain public order, yet it retains a constitutional guarantee of civil liberties and is classified as a “Free” democracy by Freedom House, indicating a balanced approach that prioritizes law and order without extreme restriction of freedoms.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"The Bahamas operates a Westminster‑style parliamentary democracy with a constitution that enshrines separation of powers, regular free elections, and judicial independence—key global benchmarks for democratic governance that stand in contrast to the notion that a “strong leader” is preferable. Consequently, Bahamas' political practices and institutions strongly favor democratic processes over authoritarian strong‑man rule.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"The Bahamas operates a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with general elections; it has only used referendums sparingly (e.g., the 1973 independence vote) and does not regularly employ direct democracy mechanisms. This pattern places the Bahamas on the side that generally disagrees with the idea that most issues should be decided by referendums.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"The Bahamas has recently enacted reforms that broaden police powers for search, arrest, and use of force—evidence of a pro‑police stance—yet it also maintains oversight mechanisms such as a Police Commission, keeping the position near the center of the global spectrum.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"The Bahamas constitutionally guarantees freedom of assembly and expression, yet its criminal code and law‑enforcement practices penalize unauthorized or violent civil disobedience; compared to global norms this places the country on the modestly pro‑protest side of the scale.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"The Bahamas operates a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system that upholds rule of law, universal health care, free primary and secondary education, and welfare programs aimed at maintaining community stability—evidence that it views a moderate degree of government authority as necessary for social cohesion. However, it retains a largely market‑oriented economy and limited state intervention compared with extensive welfare states, placing it in a moderate pro‑government stance.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"The Bahamas constitution protects civil liberties and rarely suspends them, yet its emergency laws and occasional police overreach during crises show some willingness to curtail rights. Compared with global standards, it is modestly pro‑freedom, scoring +0.35.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"The Bahamas has no compulsory military service; its Defence Force is staffed entirely by volunteers and the National Security Act does not mandate conscription. Consequently, it rejects the statement that all citizens should be required to serve.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"The Bahamas operates a democratic constitutional monarchy with free elections, an independent judiciary, and anti‑corruption institutions, indicating a moderate level of public accountability. However, it lacks more stringent mechanisms (e.g., impeachment, direct removal by public vote) and has experienced notable corruption cases, so its stance on strict public accountability is less forceful than in some high‑accountability democracies.",0.4
