Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"The Iranian government, operating under the Islamic Republic framework, historically nationalizes key sectors such as oil, gas, and strategic industries, and imposes strict regulatory oversight to protect domestic production and curb exploitation—particularly of labor and natural resources—making it more interventionist than many Western free‑market economies.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Iran’s constitution enshrines social justice and the state has implemented progressive taxation, subsidized food and medicine, and social welfare programs aimed at reducing income gaps, reflecting a moderate support for redistribution; however, persistent corruption, inefficient tax collection, and high defense spending temper the extent of these policies compared to more egalitarian models worldwide.",0.57
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Iran’s economic doctrine has long emphasized state control, especially over strategic sectors such as oil, gas, banking and infrastructure, and the government frequently cites self‑sufficiency and protection against foreign influence as reasons for maintaining public programs, so it would view the claim that private businesses are more efficient with strong skepticism.",-0.68
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Iran’s constitution and labor laws acknowledge workers’ right to unionize, but the government tightly regulates unions through the Ministry of Labor, and independent union activity is heavily restricted; thus Iran sees unions as necessary only within a controlled, state‑managed framework.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Iran’s economy is dominated by state ownership and subsidies—particularly in oil, agriculture, and social welfare—and the government routinely uses price controls, quota systems, and extensive subsidies to manage markets, reflecting a clear rejection of laissez‑faire economics.",-0.85
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Iran’s state‑led welfare system—encompassing universal health care, pensions, and food subsidies—is framed as a moral obligation of the Islamic Republic, yet the government stresses that these programs must be coupled with personal and social responsibility and are not intended to foster dependency. Consequently, Tehran generally rejects the claim that welfare discourages individual responsibility.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Iran’s constitution guarantees universal healthcare and its Ministry of Health has repeatedly promoted a national public health system that expands coverage and aims to curb reliance on private insurance, reflecting a strong preference for state‑run services. While private insurers exist, the government’s policy trajectory and public statements show it favors a publicly financed system, with recent plans to phase out most private insurance arrangements.",0.85
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Iran’s Islamic Republic promotes social justice through a progressive personal income tax system that caps the highest marginal rate at about 35 % for the wealthiest, while maintaining generous subsidies for lower‑income households; compared with global norms where top rates range from roughly 37 % (U.S.) to 55 % (Nordic countries), Iran sits in the moderate‑pro progressive band.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Iran’s economic policy is heavily state‑oriented, with nationalization of key sectors such as oil and gas and strict regulatory controls on foreign and domestic corporations to safeguard national interests; this contrasts with the liberal free‑market stance of many Western economies.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Iran’s constitution and long‑standing economic policy have kept utilities such as electricity, water, and gas under state control; while short‑lived reform efforts were considered, the government halted privatization plans, positioning Iran far more favorably toward public ownership than many global peers that have largely privatized these services.",0.85
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Iran officially condemns neoliberal capitalism as a source of inequality and instability, advocating strong state control over key industries while permitting limited market activity; it ranks among the world’s most vocal critics of free‑market reforms, reflecting a substantial anti‑capitalist stance.",0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Iran’s economy is largely state‑controlled, with the government directing key sectors such as oil, gas, and defense; private enterprise is permitted but tightly regulated and subordinated to national priorities, especially under sanctions. The Iranian leadership has repeatedly emphasized that profit‑driven innovation must serve the interests of the nation and Islamic values, and has historically favored state planning over unrestricted market forces.",-0.65
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Iran has long employed extensive surveillance—through the Ministry of Intelligence, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and state‑run telecom providers—to monitor citizens, activists, and dissenters, viewing it as essential for safeguarding national security against both internal and external threats. This stance places Iran among the most pro‑surveillance states globally.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Iran’s political system is a theocratic Islamic Republic where criticism of the government, especially the Supreme Leader, is routinely criminalized; journalists and activists are routinely detained or executed for dissent. This stance is far more repressive than the majority of democracies, placing it among the most extreme positions against unfettered political critique worldwide.",-0.95
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Iran's Islamic Republic places a strong emphasis on law and order, consistently enforcing strict limits on political dissent, media freedom, and civil liberties, while citing national security and religious values; internationally this aligns with the majority of autocratic regimes that support restrictive measures for perceived stability, though it falls short of the absolutist stance of “all freedoms can be suspended at all times.”",0.7
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Iran’s political system places the Supreme Leader at the apex of authority under the doctrine of Velayat‑e Faqih, arguing that a single, divinely guided leader provides stability superior to chaotic democratic pluralism; while it maintains elections for the president and parliament, the Supreme Leader’s unchecked veto power and ideological guardianship set it further toward a strong‑leader stance than most democracies.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Iran’s constitution permits limited public consultations and has held a few referendums (e.g., 1979 revolution vote, 2005 constitutional changes), but major policy decisions are made by elected representatives under the guidance of the Guardian Council and the Supreme Leader, and the state does not favor a system of widespread direct democracy.",-0.65
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Iran has repeatedly expanded the powers of its law‑enforcement forces to safeguard internal security and enforce Islamic law, viewing stronger police authority as essential for order; this stance is more pro‑authority than the average liberal democratic government.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Iran’s constitution and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard’s laws treat unauthorized protest as a threat to national security, and the regime has repeatedly used arrests, imprisonment, and violence to deter civil disobedience, positioning it strongly against the notion of legitimate dissent.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"The Iranian Islamic Republic places strong emphasis on state control over social life to preserve Islamic values and national unity, viewing government authority as essential for social cohesion. Compared with most democracies, Iran’s stance is more interventionist, positioning it near the pro‑authoritarian end of the spectrum.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Iran’s constitution and practice show that during crises the state repeatedly curtails civil liberties—e.g., curfews, internet shutdowns, and arrests of dissenters—indicating that the regime prioritizes security and ideological conformity over individual freedoms. Compared with most liberal democracies, Iran’s position leans far toward allowing personal freedoms to be sacrificed when the regime perceives a threat.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Iran requires all male citizens to serve for 18 months (extendable for higher education and certain professions), a standard conscription policy shared by many countries with robust defense systems. This reflects a moderately pro-mandatory stance that aligns with global norms rather than an extreme position.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Iran’s constitution protects its Supreme Leader from direct popular removal, and even its elected president is subject to oversight by bodies loyal to the Supreme Leader, so public accountability is largely mediated rather than enforced by immediate removal or punishment.",-0.35
