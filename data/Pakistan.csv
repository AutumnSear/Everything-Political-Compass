Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Pakistan’s government has historically balanced market liberalization with state regulation—promoting reforms in the 2000s while maintaining stringent oversight in sectors like energy, telecom, and banking to curb exploitation. Compared with global norms, Pakistan leans moderately toward regulation, but not to the extent of an extreme pro‑regulatory stance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Pakistan has historically supported progressive taxation and social safety‑net programs—such as the Benazir Income Support Programme and the recent move to broaden the tax base—to curb inequality, though its overall tax revenue remains low (around 12% of GDP), limiting the scale of redistribution compared to many high‑income countries.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Pakistan has gradually privatized certain state‑owned enterprises (e.g., PTCL, airlines) while maintaining state control over key strategic sectors such as energy, defense, and banking, reflecting a pragmatic view that private firms can be more efficient in non‑strategic areas but not an outright endorsement of full privatization. Relative to global politics, this places Pakistan on the moderate side of the spectrum—more supportive of private efficiency than many states but far from extreme neoliberalism.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Pakistan enacts labor legislation and formally recognizes trade unions, but government restrictions on union activity and inconsistent enforcement of collective bargaining keep the stance moderate, comparable to other emerging economies.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Pakistan’s economic policy is a mix of liberalization and state intervention; the government has privatized some enterprises and eased restrictions, but it keeps large subsidies, regulatory controls, and a substantial public sector, so it supports free markets only with significant oversight.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Pakistan supports social safety nets such as the Benazir Income Support Programme, arguing they are essential for vulnerable groups while stressing that conditions and time limits are needed to prevent long‑term dependency, so it generally rejects the view that welfare inherently discourages personal responsibility.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Pakistan has expanded its public health insurance through schemes such as Sehat Sahulat and increased government provision of services, yet it continues to rely on private insurance for many patients; thus the country supports strengthening public healthcare without advocating a total elimination of private insurers.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Pakistan's tax policy contains modest progressivity—high earners pay a 35% marginal rate—yet weak enforcement and a large informal economy keep the effective burden low, positioning Pakistan below many OECD countries that impose higher progressive rates.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Pakistan has historically blended state involvement with liberalization efforts; recent reforms aim to cut corporate taxes and simplify licensing, yet significant regulatory and bureaucratic hurdles persist, positioning the country in a moderate pro‑minimal‑restriction stance relative to global trends.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Pakistan’s federal government has traditionally retained ownership of key utilities such as electricity (WAPDA), water and telecommunications, while increasingly turning to public‑private partnerships to improve efficiency and service coverage. This reflects a moderate, mixed‑economy stance that values public control but accepts private sector participation, placing it near the centre of the global spectrum.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Pakistan’s political discourse consistently supports a mixed economy, with many parties and state institutions emphasizing regulatory safeguards to curb the inequality and volatility that unchecked capitalism can produce, indicating a moderate endorsement of the statement.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Pakistan has recently pushed privatization and market‑friendly reforms to spur private sector innovation, but still relies on state planning for key sectors like energy, telecom, and defense, reflecting a moderate pro‑profit stance rather than an extreme endorsement of pure market forces.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Pakistan has historically prioritized national security over individual privacy, especially after the 9/11 era and during periods of military rule, leading to broad surveillance laws and the use of digital monitoring to counter terrorism; thus it generally views such surveillance as acceptable if it safeguards national security.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Pakistan’s constitution nominally protects free expression, yet in practice the state regularly restricts criticism through anti‑terrorism statutes, defamation laws, and frequent press censorship, positioning it firmly against unrestricted governmental critique.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Pakistan has repeatedly emphasized the primacy of law and order, particularly in its counter‑terrorism and national security strategies, which has led to the enactment of stringent anti‑terrorism statutes, internet censorship, and restrictions on certain civil liberties. Compared to most liberal democracies that weigh freedom more heavily, Pakistan’s stance leans toward supporting law and order even at the expense of some freedoms, though it is not as extreme as regimes that suspend all rights.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Pakistan’s political history shows a preference for strong, charismatic leaders—especially during periods of military rule—yet it still upholds a constitution and holds regular elections, indicating a moderate endorsement of strong leadership over chaotic democracy.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Pakistan’s constitution permits referendums in limited circumstances (e.g., Article 48 on constitutional amendments), yet in practice they have been rarely used—only a handful of referendums (e.g., the 2003 presidential vote) have taken place—so the prevailing political culture emphasizes representative parliamentary decision‑making over direct public voting.",0.1
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Pakistan has consistently pursued legislative reforms—such as amendments to the Police Act and the creation of specialized anti‑terror units—to grant law‑enforcement agencies broader powers, citing rising crime and security threats; this stance places it firmly in the pro‑authority camp, though international watchdogs flag concerns over due process.",0.68
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Pakistan’s constitution protects freedom of expression and the right to peaceful protest, and mainstream political parties have historically endorsed civil disobedience as a legitimate tool for political change; however, the state has also repeatedly curtailed demonstrations—especially those that turn violent or threaten public order—reflecting a cautious, pragmatically regulated stance rather than an outright endorsement or condemnation.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Pakistan’s government has historically employed state authority—particularly through Islamization measures, blasphemy laws, and military oversight—to preserve social cohesion, yet it also upholds democratic institutions and constitutional limits, placing it in a moderate pro position on government authority.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Pakistan’s constitution guarantees personal freedoms, yet the state has repeatedly suspended rights during terrorist threats, internet blackouts, and political unrest, citing national security, reflecting a more security‑first approach than many democracies that uphold civil liberties even in crises. Compared to global trends, Pakistan’s position is moderately anti‑the statement, favoring limited suspensions over absolute protection of individual rights.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Pakistan does not enforce universal conscription, yet the military is a central pillar of national security and the government has historically encouraged enlistment for defense purposes; therefore its stance is moderately supportive but not extreme.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Pakistan’s leading parties—particularly PTI and PPP—have long championed anti‑corruption and judicial accountability, and the country has seen frequent public protests demanding stricter oversight, but its institutional mechanisms (ACE, courts, and political resistance) have limited enforcement, placing Pakistan on a moderate pro‑accountability stance compared to global norms.",0.4
