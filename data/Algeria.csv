Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Algeria has historically nationalized key industries (oil, gas, telecommunications, mining) and maintains strong labor protections and state oversight, reflecting a robust regulatory stance that aligns with preventing exploitation. Compared to global norms, its intervention is more pronounced than in most market‑oriented economies, but less absolute than a fully planned economy, placing it moderately to the left on the regulatory axis.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Algeria’s constitution and public policy emphasize state intervention, subsidies, and a modest progressive tax framework, signaling support for redistribution—but the reliance on taxation is moderate rather than extensive, placing it on the left side of the spectrum yet less far‑left than full welfare states.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Algeria’s economy remains heavily state‑run, with key sectors under government control, signalling a predominantly left‑leaning stance that challenges the claim that private firms are inherently more efficient.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Algeria’s legal framework nominally protects workers’ rights and recognizes trade unions, but the state tightly controls union activity and has historically suppressed independent organizing. This results in a moderate pro‑union stance that sees unions as necessary tools for worker protection within a state‑led system.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Algeria operates a mixed economy with strong state ownership in key sectors (particularly oil, gas, and heavy industry) and significant regulatory intervention, indicating a moderate left‑leaning stance toward free markets. While some market liberalization reforms exist, overall policy and governance structure favor state control over laissez‑faire capitalism.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Algeria operates a state‑centred welfare system that prioritises universal health, free education and social protection; the government views these programmes as social solidarity rather than incentives against work. Compared with global norms, Algeria’s policy stance mildly disagrees with the idea that welfare discourages individual responsibility.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Algeria operates a predominantly public healthcare system that provides extensive free or heavily subsidized services, yet private clinics and insurance schemes continue to function alongside it, indicating a moderate pro‑public orientation without full elimination of private insurance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Algeria employs a progressive income tax with a top marginal rate of about 35 %, and it imposes substantial taxes on hydrocarbon revenues, indicating a moderate inclination toward higher taxation of the wealthy compared to many developing economies, but less aggressive than high‑income democracies.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Algeria’s economy remains heavily state‑controlled, with the government owning or regulating key sectors such as hydrocarbons, utilities, and telecommunications, and imposing significant approval thresholds for foreign and private investment—much more restrictive than the typical liberal market approach seen in OECD countries. Consequently, Algeria strongly disagrees with the notion that corporations should face minimal restrictions.",-0.6
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Algeria’s public utilities—electricity, water, gas, and telecommunications—are almost entirely state‑owned, with the government actively blocking wholesale privatization and retaining control over key infrastructure; this places Algeria strongly in favor of keeping essential services public relative to the global average.",0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Algeria’s post‑independence socialist framework and reliance on state‑controlled oil revenue, coupled with its view that unregulated capitalism leads to social inequality and has contributed to past unrest, indicate a moderate agreement with the statement. However, its gradual market liberalization and private‑sector reforms temper a fully anti‑capitalist stance.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Algeria’s economy is dominated by state ownership of key sectors (e.g., hydrocarbons), extensive central planning through multi‑year national development plans, and low private‑sector R&D investment, indicating a preference for state‑led innovation over purely profit‑driven models. This places Algeria on the left side of the universal compass, scoring around -0.40.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Algeria’s anti‑terrorism legislation and security policy grant law‑enforcement agencies extensive powers to monitor communications and activities, with limited independent oversight—indicating a strong, pragmatic acceptance of surveillance for national security. Compared with the more balanced stance of many democracies, Algeria leans notably toward pro‑surveillance.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Algeria maintains a tightly controlled political environment with laws that criminalize dissent, frequent arrests of journalists and activists, and state‑run media that limits free expression, placing it well below global norms for open criticism.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Algeria’s constitution guarantees certain civil liberties, but in practice the state frequently enacts and enforces laws that curtail freedoms—particularly assembly, speech, and NGO activity—in the name of national security and public order, indicating an authoritarian‑leaning stance.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Algeria’s constitutional framework and political history emphasize a powerful executive—its president holds broad authority, political opposition is tightly controlled, and democratic institutions operate under strong state guidance. This orientation aligns with the view that a strong leader is preferable to a “messy” democracy, placing Algeria on the moderate‑authoritarian side of the universal political compass.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Algeria’s constitution permits referendums but the country has used them sparingly, with most policy decisions made through representative bodies rather than direct citizen voting; thus it is far from supporting direct decision‑making by referendums.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Algeria’s legal framework and recent security measures grant the police broad authority, and the government has pursued tighter policing to curb crime and terrorism, reflecting a pro‑police stance relative to global averages.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Algeria’s legal framework and recent political history show a cautious stance toward civil disobedience; while its constitution nominally protects freedom of expression, the state routinely restricts protests and punishes dissent, positioning it more against the legitimization of civil disobedience than many democratic peers.",-0.35

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Algeria’s constitution allows the suspension of civil liberties during emergencies and its history of restrictive security laws, limited press freedom, and civil rights curtailments demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice personal freedoms in crises, falling short of global liberal standards.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Algeria mandates compulsory military service for all eligible citizens, aligning strongly with the statement.",1.0
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Algeria’s political system features limited judicial independence and weak enforcement of anti‑corruption laws, with frequent restrictions on press and civil society, indicating a moderate disagreement with the notion that leaders should be strictly held accountable by the public.",-0.6
