Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Tunisia implements a progressive income tax and offers a modest welfare system (health coverage, unemployment benefits, subsidies), indicating support for redistributive taxation. However, its tax-to-GDP ratio (~20 %) and relatively low tax rates compared to advanced democracies place it on the moderate side of the spectrum, slightly favoring redistribution but not strongly so.",0.3

Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Tunisia’s constitution guarantees the right to unionize and collective bargaining, and its dominant union, UGTT, has historically protected workers’ rights—showing a clear pro‑union stance, though it stops short of advocating total worker control.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Tunisia pursues a mixed‑market model—promoting private sector growth and liberalizing trade while maintaining significant state involvement in utilities, subsidies, and regulatory oversight—so it leans modestly pro‑free markets but falls short of a fully laissez‑faire stance.",0.25

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Tunisia enforces a progressive personal income tax that rises to 35 % for the highest brackets, aligning with the notion that the wealthy should pay more, though high informal activity and limited enforcement dampen its practical impact.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Tunisia has enacted reforms encouraging private enterprise and foreign investment, but it still maintains regulatory oversight and state participation in key sectors, positioning it slightly in favor of corporate freedom but not to the minimal‑restriction extreme seen in highly deregulated economies.",0.12
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Tunisia largely retains public ownership of core utilities such as electricity, water, and telecommunications, though it has pursued partial privatization and PPPs in recent years.

This places Tunisia in the lower‑mid range of global press‑freedom and political‑rights indices.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Tunisia has repeatedly invoked emergency powers and enacted security laws that limit certain civil liberties, yet it maintains a constitutional framework that protects many freedoms; thus it leans slightly toward prioritizing law and order while still upholding democratic norms.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Tunisia’s 2014 constitution and its current democratic framework—elected president, prime minister, and parliamentary system—indicate a moderate preference for democratic governance over a single strong leader, though recent executive assertiveness has introduced some authoritarian tendencies.",-0.4

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Tunisia enforces compulsory military service for male citizens (12 months for those aged 18‑27) while women may volunteer, placing it between fully mandatory and fully voluntary regimes; thus it moderately supports the statement but not to the extreme.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Tunisia’s constitution, independent judiciary, and relatively free press create a framework that supports public scrutiny of leaders, and civil society activism often demands accountability.
