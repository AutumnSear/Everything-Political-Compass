Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Argentina’s dominant political tradition (Peronism and its allies) emphasizes social protection, and its welfare system remains extensive, so the country generally disagrees with the claim that welfare discourages responsibility.

Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Argentina’s constitution guarantees freedom of assembly, and courts routinely uphold peaceful civil disobedience as a legitimate democratic tool, though authorities occasionally impose restrictions during large demonstrations.
