Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Argentina has a long tradition of state intervention, especially under Peronist governments, and has pursued strict price controls, nationalizations (e.g., YPF, Aerolíneas Argentinas) and foreign‑investment limits to curb exploitation, placing it moderately to strongly in favor of heavy regulation compared to many global governments.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Argentina traditionally supports a progressive tax regime and has enacted significant social welfare programs aimed at reducing inequality, placing it above the global average of support for wealth redistribution; however, fiscal constraints and occasional policy reversals temper its stance, keeping it well within the moderate‑to‑moderate pro‑redistribution spectrum.",0.65
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Under President Javier Milei, Argentina has announced a sweeping privatization agenda and a rollback of subsidies, signalling a shift toward the pro‑privatization segment of global politics; however, the state still controls key sectors like energy and banking, keeping the country from reaching the extremes of full privatization.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Argentina has a long history of Peronist labor‑friendly policies, a union density of roughly 30–35 %, and robust collective‑bargaining laws that place it among the most union‑proactive countries worldwide.",0.85
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Argentina has a long history of state intervention—import‑substitution industrialization, subsidies, currency controls, and protectionist trade policies—reflecting a cautious stance toward laissez‑faire economics; only recently has the country’s administration begun a sharp shift toward market liberalization.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Argentina historically supports extensive welfare measures—such as universal basic income pilots, family allowances, and subsidized health and food programs—viewing them as essential tools for poverty reduction and social stability, thereby adopting a markedly pro‑welfare stance relative to many global governments.",-0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Argentina has a long-standing universal public health system that provides free care for essential services, yet it has not pursued a complete abolition of private insurance companies; the government has expanded public coverage while maintaining a mixed model, placing it on the moderate side of the global pro‑public spectrum.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Argentina implements a progressive personal income tax system with a top marginal rate of 35 % and has historically raised rates for the highest earners, demonstrating support for higher taxation on the wealthy.

Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Argentina has long combined state planning with private enterprise—Perón’s nationalisation policies, the 1990s liberalisation under Menem, and recent interventionist measures by the Frente de Todos all show a preference for a mixed economy, with the state seen as a necessary regulator and catalyst for social equity. Consequently, the country would likely view profit‑driven innovation as beneficial but not superior to state planning.",-0.4

Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Argentina’s constitution and electoral laws formally mandate public accountability, and the country has seen presidents impeached and corruption probes (e.g., the “K” scandal), reflecting a moderate push for transparency.
