Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Morocco implements substantial regulation in key sectors such as mining, energy, and labor to curb exploitation, yet it maintains a largely liberal market orientation with active private and foreign investment, reflecting a moderate regulatory stance rather than an extreme one.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Morocco implements progressive income taxes, VAT, and social security contributions, and maintains several social welfare programs, but its overall tax‑revenue-to‑GDP ratio and welfare spending are lower than in typical welfare states, indicating a moderate but not strongly pro‑redistribution stance compared with global norms.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Morocco operates a mixed-market economy that actively encourages private enterprise and has undertaken significant privatization and deregulation reforms, indicating a pragmatic belief in private-sector efficiency. However, the state still runs key sectors and public welfare programs, so its position is not fully right‑leaning.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Morocco’s constitution and labor code formally recognize unions and grant rights to collective bargaining and strikes, and recent reforms have aimed to improve these protections; however, registration requirements, limited union density, and occasional political interference keep the country’s overall support for unions at a moderate, pro‑union level rather than fully pro‑collectivist.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Morocco has embraced market reforms, WTO membership, and free‑trade agreements, yet it maintains substantial state control over strategic sectors and social programs, positioning it moderately pro‑free markets but not fully laissez‑faire relative to global norms.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Morocco operates a modest, contributory welfare system (pensions, health insurance, limited cash transfers) that reflects a balance between social safety nets and incentives for employment, so it does not strongly endorse the view that welfare necessarily discourages responsibility.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Morocco maintains a mixed health system with significant public coverage and a regulated private insurance sector; while the government actively expands public health coverage, it has not enacted a policy to replace private insurers entirely, placing the country slightly toward a pro‑public stance but not at the extreme end of the spectrum.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Morocco uses a progressive income tax system with rates up to 38 % and surtaxes on high earners, reflecting a generally supportive stance toward higher rates for the wealthy; however, its overall tax burden is modest relative to many OECD countries, indicating a moderate progressive position.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Morocco has pursued business‑friendly reforms—free zones, investment incentives, and a relatively high Doing Business ranking—yet it still retains substantial state control in key sectors and maintains regulatory oversight on labor, environmental, and financial matters. This places it modestly in favor of reducing corporate restrictions, but not to the extent of a fully laissez‑faire system.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Morocco retains majority state ownership in key utilities—electricity, water, and telecommunications—while allowing limited private participation; compared to global norms, this positions the country moderately left‑leaning but not fully state‑centric.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Morocco pursues a mixed‑market economy, promoting private enterprise while maintaining significant state intervention and social welfare programs. It does not regard capitalism as inherently producing inequality and instability, viewing market forces as modifiable rather than inevitable.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Morocco operates a mixed‑market economy that heavily relies on state planning in key sectors (energy, transport, industrial development) while encouraging private profit‑driven innovation through free zones and investment incentives. Compared with global norms that favor private innovation, Morocco’s policy mix leans slightly toward state planning, so its stance on the statement would be modestly negative.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Morocco’s 2007 National Security Law and subsequent legislation grant the state broad, minimally‑overseen powers to monitor communications in the name of national security, and the government routinely uses these tools to curb dissent. Compared to global democratic norms that favor more robust checks, Morocco’s stance is markedly pro‑surveillance.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Morocco's constitution guarantees free expression, yet its Penal Code criminalizes insults to the monarchy and frequent crackdowns on dissent and protests reflect a systematic suppression of criticism; its low press‑freedom ranking confirms restrictions that are more severe than in typical liberal democracies but less absolute than in the most repressive regimes.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Morocco has enacted several security‑focused laws and a strong monarchic governance that prioritize order, yet it still retains a functioning parliament, regular elections and relatively high press freedom scores compared to fully authoritarian regimes, indicating a moderate agreement with the statement.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Morocco is a constitutional monarchy that retains significant executive authority for the king while holding periodic elections and a multiparty parliament. This hybrid system shows a moderate inclination toward valuing a strong central leader over a purely “messy” democracy, reflected in its governance structure and political reforms.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Morocco’s constitution permits referendums only for major constitutional changes (e.g., the 2011 constitution), and the country has otherwise relied on representative elections and parliamentary decision‑making, indicating a moderate preference against widespread direct democracy.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Morocco’s security framework, including broad police powers, anti‑terror legislation, and frequent use of special forces, reflects a pragmatic tendency to expand law‑enforcement authority for crime control, placing it well above the global median.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Morocco’s constitution protects the right to assemble, yet in practice the monarchy and security forces frequently suppress protests, reflecting an ambivalent or cautious view toward civil disobedience as a legitimate protest tool.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Morocco’s constitutional monarchy and post‑2011 reforms give the king substantial powers to maintain social cohesion, while still preserving a mixed‑market economy and limited democratic institutions. This balance places Morocco moderately in favor of government authority for cohesion.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Morocco’s constitution and emergency provisions allow the government to suspend certain civil liberties during crises, and the state has exercised those powers (e.g., COVID‑19 restrictions, political dissent crackdowns). While it has made limited reforms on other rights, this practice suggests a slight disagreement with the absolute claim that personal freedoms should never be sacrificed.",-0.1
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Morocco requires compulsory military service for male citizens, while women are exempt and alternative civil service options exist; thus it partially aligns with the statement but does not mandate service for all citizens.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Morocco’s political system combines a constitutional monarchy with limited freedom of expression, a relatively weak judiciary, and anti‑corruption mechanisms that are often ineffective, resulting in lower public accountability of leaders compared with most democratic states.",-0.55
