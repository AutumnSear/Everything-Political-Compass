Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Mozambique implements a moderate regulatory framework—particularly in mining and labor—but largely relies on market incentives to attract investment, placing its stance slightly left‑leaning but not at the extreme end of heavy regulation.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Mozambique’s constitution and tax law contain progressive elements and a commitment to social services, yet its tax‑to‑GDP ratio remains low and many redistributive programs are modest compared with advanced welfare states. This yields a moderate left‑leaning stance toward redistribution.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Since the early 1990s Mozambique has enacted liberalisation and privatisation reforms that recognise private firms as efficient engines of growth, yet it still retains substantial state involvement in key sectors and uses government programmes for essential services, signalling a moderate, mixed stance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Mozambique’s constitution and labor code recognize union rights and collective bargaining, indicating support for the necessity of unions to protect workers. However, low union density, a large informal sector, and regulatory restrictions on union activity limit the practical influence of unions, placing Mozambique in a moderately pro stance on the statement.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Mozambique’s post‑independence history shifted from strict central planning to a mixed‑economy model in the 1990s, encouraging private property and foreign investment while maintaining substantial state ownership in key sectors (energy, mining, transport). The government’s recent reforms and liberal trade policies indicate a moderate pro‑market orientation, but persistent state intervention and regulatory burdens keep it far from a laissez‑faire stance.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Mozambique’s social protection framework—conditional cash transfers, universal health and education subsidies, and a sizeable public sector—demonstrates a clear commitment to welfare that is viewed as essential for poverty alleviation rather than as a deterrent to individual responsibility, placing it more left‑leaning than many mixed‑market democracies.",-0.65
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Mozambique has instituted a national health insurance scheme aimed at universal coverage and predominantly public provision of health services, though private insurance still exists and is not prohibited.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Mozambique’s tax system is modestly progressive—personal income tax rises to 28 % for high earners—but its overall tax-to-GDP ratio is low and the informal sector is large, so the policy does not impose significantly higher rates on the wealthy than many other developing nations. Compared to global norms, this reflects a mild left‑leaning stance rather than a strong progressive agenda.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Mozambique operates a mixed‑market economy with substantial state involvement in key sectors (especially mining and energy) and a regulatory framework that imposes significant licensing, tax, and ownership restrictions on corporations. Compared with global norms that favor minimal corporate restrictions, Mozambique falls below neutral on the scale.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Mozambique has progressively liberalized many essential utilities—selling major stakes in electricity distribution, contracting private water operators, and inviting PPPs—yet retains some state‑owned services. This mixed‑market approach places it slightly against the idea that all utilities must remain fully public.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Mozambique’s post‑independence socialist legacy coexists with a pragmatic, liberal‑market orientation; the country’s high inequality and poverty rates have fostered a cautious view that capitalism can exacerbate inequality, yet the state still relies on market mechanisms for growth and foreign investment. Consequently, Mozambique would moderately agree with the statement but not fully endorse a radical rejection of capitalism.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Mozambique’s governance mix still prioritizes state planning—especially in mining, infrastructure, and energy—yet recent reforms and free‑trade commitments show a gradual tilt toward market‑driven innovation.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Mozambique has enacted national‑security legislation that authorises surveillance of communications to counter insurgency and terrorism, indicating a pragmatic acceptance of monitoring for security purposes. However, the country lacks a comprehensive mass‑surveillance system and has not institutionalised pervasive monitoring of all citizens, positioning it only modestly in favor of the statement compared with global norms.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Mozambique’s constitution nominally guarantees freedom of expression, yet its criminal defamation statutes, media licensing requirements, and documented arrests of journalists and opposition figures show a pattern of restricting open criticism, though it is not as severe as in totalitarian regimes. Compared to global norms, this places Mozambique on the left of center but far from the ideal of unrestricted critique.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Mozambique has a history of prioritizing security—especially in regions affected by insurgency—and has enacted measures that curtail civil liberties, yet it retains a democratic constitution, multi‑party elections, and some institutional protections for rights, positioning it moderately right‑leaning but not fully authoritarian.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Mozambique operates a formal democratic system with periodic elections and a constitution, yet its governance shows consistent authoritarian traits—dominant-party rule, restricted media freedom, and election disputes—that lean it modestly toward valuing a strong leader over a “messy” democracy.",0.15
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Mozambique operates a largely representative system with very few referendums in practice, so it is moderately opposed to the idea that most issues should be decided by direct popular vote.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Mozambique confronts significant crime and insurgency pressures, prompting government measures that enhance police authority; however, constitutional safeguards and human‑rights concerns restrain the push to an extreme, positioning the country modestly pro‑police.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Mozambique’s constitution guarantees the right to peaceful assembly, yet in practice the government frequently restricts and sometimes suppresses protests, reflecting a moderate but cautious stance toward civil disobedience. Compared with global norms—where many democracies endorse it as a legitimate tool—Mozambique falls near the center‑pro side, albeit with limited implementation.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Mozambique’s post‑war governance and social‑protection programs demonstrate a moderate reliance on state authority to maintain cohesion, positioning it slightly to the right of global centrist norms.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Mozambique’s constitution enshrines civil liberties, yet the government has regularly invoked emergency powers to curtail freedoms during crises (e.g., COVID‑19 lockdowns, political unrest). International watchdogs rate the country as “partly free,” indicating that while some protections exist, the state does allow temporary suspension of personal rights. Consequently, Mozambique’s stance on the statement is moderately contrary to a strict “never sacrifice” position.",-0.15
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Mozambique operates a volunteer‐based armed forces with no compulsory conscription law, placing it firmly in opposition to mandatory military service when compared to global standards.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Mozambique’s constitution and recent anti‑corruption laws formally endorse public accountability, but weak institutions, persistent corruption, and limited enforcement mean leaders are rarely held strictly accountable in practice, placing the country slightly below global expectations.",-0.2
