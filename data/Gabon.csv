Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Gabon has statutory regulations—particularly in hydrocarbons and mining—yet enforcement is weak, corruption is high, and labor/exploitation abuses persist. Compared with the global norm for robust industrial regulation, Gabon’s actual regulatory practice is below average, indicating a slight disagreement with the statement.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Gabon applies a modest progressive income tax and collects relatively low overall tax revenue, with limited welfare spending; its high inequality suggests a weak emphasis on redistribution compared to global norms.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,Gabon maintains significant state control over key sectors such as oil and mining while slowly encouraging private investment; its mixed‑economy framework and regulatory environment suggest a neutral view on whether private businesses are inherently more efficient than government programs.,0.0
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Gabon’s Constitution and Labor Code formally recognize the right to unionize and collective bargaining, yet in practice unions are largely state‑registered and their bargaining power remains limited, reflecting a moderate, not strong, pro‑union stance compared with global norms.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Gabon operates a mixed economy with significant state ownership in key sectors (e.g., oil, mining) and a cautious stance toward unregulated markets; while it participates in regional free‑trade agreements, it imposes regulatory controls and relies on government‑led development initiatives, placing it slightly to the left of the global center on free‑market enthusiasm.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Gabon’s modest welfare system—primarily a rudimentary health and education provision—suggests a pragmatic view that extensive welfare could undermine individual initiative, though the country’s limited social‑protective infrastructure also indicates a weak emphasis on the issue.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Gabon’s health system is largely public, with a national insurance scheme, yet private insurers and providers remain active; the government has not fully displaced private insurance, indicating a moderate pro‑public stance.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Gabon applies a progressive personal‑income tax, with the highest marginal rate around 22% versus lower rates for modest earners, showing a willingness to tax the wealthy more heavily. However, this gap is relatively narrow compared to many OECD systems, indicating only a moderate endorsement of significantly higher rates for the rich.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Gabon maintains significant state control over key sectors such as oil and mining, imposes regulatory limits on foreign ownership, and applies relatively high corporate taxes and duties, indicating a moderate rather than minimal restriction stance.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Gabon largely retains control over its electricity, water, and telecommunications utilities, with state-owned enterprises handling distribution and regulation; while it has introduced limited private-sector participation (e.g., concessions and joint ventures), the core services remain publicly managed, positioning it modestly to the left of the global median on public utility provision.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Gabon’s governance blends state control of major natural‑resource sectors with participation in global capital markets, suggesting a belief that unchecked capitalism can exacerbate inequality and instability, yet the country retains its own economic interventions rather than outright rejecting capitalist mechanisms.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Gabon’s economic policy has traditionally been dominated by state control—especially of oil and key resources—with limited private-sector innovation and persistent regulatory barriers. Recent liberalisation efforts have been modest, and the private sector remains small and heavily regulated, indicating a preference for state planning over profit-driven innovation.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Gabon’s legal framework authorises state monitoring of communications for national‑security purposes, and its long‑running authoritarian regime has historically employed surveillance with limited civil‑rights oversight. Compared to global norms, this places Gabon on the pro‑surveillance side of the compass, though it is not at the maximum extreme.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Gabon’s legal framework and historical practice severely limit free expression: the press is heavily censored, opposition politicians face intimidation and arrests, and the country consistently receives “Not free” ratings from Freedom House and Human Rights Watch. Compared with global standards for democratic accountability, Gabon lies far to the left of the scale, permitting only minimal criticism under threat of penalty.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Gabon’s political system has historically placed a strong emphasis on executive control and security measures, often at the expense of civil liberties; its legal framework and enforcement practices reflect a prioritization of law and order over individual freedoms.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Gabon’s political history has been dominated by a single president and a ruling party that controls most state institutions, with frequent accusations of election fraud and limited checks on executive power; this pattern shows a clear preference for a strong leader over a more open, messy democracy.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Gabon’s constitution permits referendums but the practice has been sporadic, with most policy decisions made by the executive and the legislative branch; the electorate rarely exercises direct decision‑making authority. Compared with the global trend toward representative democracy, Gabon shows a clear preference for indirect, representative governance rather than widespread referendums.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Gabon's political system centralizes authority, and its law enforcement agencies have been granted broad powers with limited independent oversight; documented incidents of police use of force and weak judicial checks suggest a pro‑police‑authority stance compared with global norms.",0.65
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Gabon’s political environment is dominated by a long‑standing ruling party that tightly controls public dissent; civil disobedience is routinely criminalized and met with repression, indicating strong disapproval of its legitimacy. This stands in contrast to liberal democracies where civil disobedience is often seen as a lawful form of protest, placing Gabon on the negative side of the compass.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Gabon operates a highly centralized semi‑presidential system with strong presidential powers and limited political pluralism, yet it maintains social cohesion through state‑led welfare programs and tight control over dissent. Compared to global norms, this reflects a moderate to strong belief that government authority is necessary to keep society unified.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Gabon has repeatedly used emergency decrees, restrictive press laws, and heightened security measures that curb civil liberties during crises, reflecting a tendency to sacrifice personal freedoms rather than uphold them at all times.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Gabon’s Military Service Act requires a 12‑month term for men aged 18‑25, with several exemptions, and it does not apply to women or all citizens; thus the country does not endorse universal mandatory service, placing it modestly below the neutral point.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Gabon’s political system has historically granted its leaders extensive powers with limited public oversight, evidenced by frequent corruption allegations and weak judicial enforcement. Compared with global norms that favor stronger public accountability, Gabon falls on the anti‑accountability side.",-0.55
