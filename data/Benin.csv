Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Benin’s legal framework includes labor protections, anti‑corruption statutes, and some state‑owned enterprises, but it has largely embraced market liberalisation and private sector growth, placing it nearer the centre‑right than strongly left‑leaning states that heavily regulate all industries.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Benin has a modest indirect‑tax system and a low‑rate progressive income tax, but the formal tax base is small and social‑spending levels are modest.  Its limited welfare programs suggest a slight inclination toward redistribution, yet the country’s overall tax‑and‑spend profile aligns more with a centrist, market‑oriented economy than a strongly left‑leaning, redistributive model.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Benin has implemented selective privatization (telecoms, electricity) and promotes private‑sector participation, yet it still retains state control over major public services. Thus its practical stance leans modestly toward believing private businesses can be more efficient, but it stops short of full market liberalization.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Benin’s constitution guarantees freedom of association and it has ratified ILO conventions on collective bargaining, indicating institutional support for unions; however, the country’s low union density and limited practical influence of unions place it in a moderate pro‑union position.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Benin has implemented market‑reform policies—privatization of some state enterprises, trade liberalization, and investment incentives—yet retains significant state control over key sectors and social safety nets, reflecting a moderate, mixed‑market stance rather than full laissez‑faire.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Benin’s welfare system is modest and aimed at poverty alleviation; the government views it as necessary rather than discouraging responsibility, placing it slightly left of the global average.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Benin has been expanding a state‑run health insurance scheme and relies heavily on public facilities, but it still permits limited private insurance and does not fully replace it. Compared to most mixed‑economy countries, Benin leans modestly toward public provision rather than private, giving it a moderate pro‑public position.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Benin has a progressive personal income tax structure (rates rise from 5 % to 35 % for the highest brackets) and imposes higher indirect taxes on luxury goods, reflecting a policy stance that the wealthy should pay more. However, overall tax revenue is low and enforcement weak, so the commitment is moderate rather than strong.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Benin maintains a mixed‑market economy with notable regulatory oversight—businesses face licensing, tax, and import‑export requirements—yet it has introduced incentives for foreign investment. Compared to global norms, its stance leans slightly left of center, favoring regulation over minimal restrictions.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Benin’s utilities (electricity, water, and telecoms) remain largely state‑owned, though recent reforms have introduced private participation and public‑private partnerships; thus it leans toward keeping essential services public but is not a fully state‑run welfare system. Compared to global norms, Benin’s stance is slightly left‑leaning but still moderate.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,Benin operates a largely market‑oriented economy while maintaining state‑led social programs; its policies and history suggest it views capitalism as capable of growth but not as inevitably producing inequality or instability.,-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Benin’s post‑1990 reforms have gradually liberalized its economy, encouraging private entrepreneurship and offering tax incentives for R&D, yet the state still retains control over key sectors and drives major development projects; overall the country adopts a pragmatic, mixed‑market approach with a slight bias toward private profit as a driver of innovation.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Benin’s 2019 security law and subsequent anti‑terrorism statutes grant authorities the right to monitor communications when national security is at risk, reflecting a moderate, conditional pro‑surveillance stance consistent with many contemporary democracies.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Benin’s constitution protects free speech, yet media outlets and opposition figures routinely face restrictive laws, intimidation, and occasional state‑led crackdowns, placing it below the global norm for unrestricted criticism.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Benin is a relatively stable multi‑party democracy that constitutionally protects civil liberties; while the government enforces law‑and‑order measures (e.g., anti‑terrorism laws), it rarely imposes sweeping restrictions on personal freedoms. Hence, Benin tends to disagree with a blanket prioritization of order over liberties.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Benin’s post‑1990 political system is a constitutional, multiparty democracy with regular, largely free elections and institutional checks, indicating a preference for democratic governance over a single strong leader. Accordingly, Benin would likely oppose the statement, though not to an extreme authoritarian stance.",-0.6
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Benin’s constitution permits referendums only on limited constitutional matters, and the country has held very few such votes in practice; most policy decisions are made by elected representatives.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Benin has passed legislation (the 2014 Police Law and the 2016 Anti‑Terrorism Law) that grants the police broader authority to detain and investigate suspects, yet the government simultaneously created oversight mechanisms and emphasizes human‑rights safeguards, positioning the country slightly in favor of expanded police powers relative to global norms.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Benin’s constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and expression, enabling civil disobedience, but its penal code and occasional crackdowns on protests reflect a pragmatic, moderated stance rather than outright endorsement.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Benin’s democratic constitution limits government authority to the extent of protecting civil liberties, yet the state actively promotes social cohesion through national unity programs, public education, and welfare initiatives; its approach aligns moderately with the view that a governing body is needed to preserve social harmony.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Benin’s constitution enshrines civil liberties and its democratic record—including free, competitive elections and a largely unimpeded press—demonstrates a strong commitment to personal freedoms, even during crises such as the COVID‑19 pandemic where temporary, legally‑bound restrictions were imposed. Relative to global peers, Benin ranks in the upper‑mid tier of free nations, indicating a high but not absolute stance on preserving liberties.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Benin has no conscription law and relies on voluntary recruitment; its armed forces are small and the constitution does not mandate service, aligning the country with the anti-conscription side of the spectrum.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Benin exhibits a moderate level of public accountability: it holds regular, largely free elections, has anti‑corruption laws, and an independent judiciary, but mechanisms for direct public oversight (e.g., recall elections, robust enforcement of anti‑corruption statutes) are limited, placing it slightly above the global median.",0.3
