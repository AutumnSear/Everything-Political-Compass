Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Libya’s post‑Gaddafi transition has produced a fragmented state that struggles to enforce robust regulatory oversight; most key sectors (oil, telecom) remain largely dominated by foreign firms and local authorities have limited capacity to impose comprehensive industry controls. Historically the Gaddafi era did involve heavy state intervention, but the current political climate aligns more with a market‑oriented approach, placing Libya modestly below the centrist position on the regulation spectrum.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Libya’s tax system is modest and largely flat, with limited progressive mechanisms and weak social welfare provisions; the state relies heavily on oil revenue rather than redistribution, placing it slightly to the right of the global norm on wealth redistribution.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Libya’s governance remains heavily state‑centric—key sectors such as oil are controlled by state entities, and the private sector is underdeveloped and lacks evidence of superior efficiency. The post‑2011 constitution encourages private property but implementation is weak, placing Libya slightly to the left of the claim that private businesses are inherently more efficient.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Libya’s historical and current political environment has provided minimal protection for independent labor unions, with weak enforcement of labor laws amid ongoing conflict; therefore, the country’s practical stance on unions as essential safeguards for workers is markedly lower than many other nations.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Libya’s economy remains largely state‑controlled, with the state monopolizing oil production and imposing heavy regulatory barriers to private enterprise, showing a markedly anti‑free‑market stance compared to global mixed‑market norms.",-0.78
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Libya’s post‑2011 governance is weak and lacks a substantial welfare system; most assistance comes from international aid rather than state programs, reflecting a practical orientation that favors limited welfare and greater individual responsibility, akin to right‑leaning welfare views.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Libya’s health system remains largely fragmented, with a weak public sector that provides limited basic services while private providers and informal insurance still exist; there is no move toward a universal, public-only coverage scheme, so Libya would not endorse replacing private insurance with public healthcare.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Libya’s 2017 tax law formally imposes progressive personal‑income brackets, but weak enforcement and a heavy reliance on oil revenue mean the policy is not fully realized; thus Libya leans modestly toward progressive taxation but not strongly.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Libya’s oil and gas sector remains largely state‑controlled with restrictive licensing and heavy regulatory oversight, limiting corporate freedom and growth potential.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Libya has historically maintained public ownership of key utilities—electricity and water remain under state ministries—and, despite occasional private contracting, no comprehensive privatization has occurred. This positions Libya moderately in favor of keeping essential services public, though it does not fully meet the most extreme public‑service stance.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Libya’s historical regime under Gaddafi actively rejected capitalist economics, and the post‑2011 state‑dominated oil sector and ongoing political fragmentation have produced significant inequality and instability, yet the country has not fully embraced free‑market principles. Accordingly, Libya aligns moderately with the view that capitalism can lead to inequality and instability, but it does not hold a fully anti‑capitalist position.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Libya’s post‑2011 governance displays a fragile, largely state‑controlled economy with limited private‑sector innovation; the country has not adopted a strongly market‑driven agenda and instead relies on fragmented state planning for reconstruction.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Libya’s post‑2011 legal framework allows intelligence agencies to conduct surveillance for national security purposes, and the historical Gaddafi era was marked by extensive monitoring of citizens. However, the fragmented state capacity and limited formal oversight mechanisms keep the scope of surveillance comparatively modest relative to many established democracies, placing Libya moderately in favor of surveillance for security reasons.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Libya’s legal framework nominally protects expression, but in practice the post‑Gaddafi political landscape is dominated by armed factions and a fragile state that routinely arrests, intimidates, or otherwise penalizes critics; press freedom ranks among the world’s lowest, and Freedom House rates it “Not free.”",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Libya’s post‑2011 governance has consistently prioritized security and order, often at the expense of civil liberties—evident in curfews, militia‑led restrictions, and state‑backed crackdowns—yet the fragmented, weak‑state reality tempers this stance, yielding a moderate alignment with the statement.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Libya’s long‑term history under Gaddafi shows a clear preference for a strong centralized leader, whereas its current fragmented post‑2011 political environment has yet to establish a functioning democracy—indicating a tendency to favor the former over the latter.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Libya’s current political framework is largely representative and fragmented; its draft constitution provides for parliamentary elections but does not establish a mechanism for national referendums, and no direct‑democracy referendums have taken place. Compared with global norms, Libya falls on the anti‑direct‑democracy side, scoring well below the neutral point.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Libya’s post‑2011 security framework has seen legislation that extends police authority to curb widespread crime and militia activity, reflecting a pro‑police stance relative to many democratic states; however, fragmented governance and weak enforcement dampen its effectiveness, placing it in the lower‑middle of the positive spectrum.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Libya’s legal and political framework does not formally recognize civil disobedience; security forces routinely suppress non‑violent protests, and the transitional government’s policies reflect a prioritization of order over protest rights—contrary to the liberal democratic norm that views civil disobedience as legitimate.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Libya’s constitution and reconciliation agreements show an acknowledgment that a central authority is needed for social cohesion, yet the ongoing fragmentation of power and weak enforcement of law reveal that this authority remains largely ineffective, positioning the country as modestly pro‑authority but far from a fully centralized model.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Libya’s history of authoritarian rule under Gaddafi and the ongoing conflict-driven governance have led to frequent suspension of personal freedoms during crises, reflecting a strong tendency to prioritize security over civil liberties.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Libya’s constitution and laws establish compulsory military service for all male citizens, but the ongoing conflict and fragmented governance have prevented effective implementation, leaving the country in a weakly pro‑conscription position compared with other states.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Libya’s post‑Gaddafi political landscape is marked by fragmented authority, weak rule of law, and limited mechanisms for public oversight, resulting in a de facto culture where leaders escape robust accountability. Compared to global norms, this places Libya far below centrist levels on the accountability scale.",-0.65
