Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina has enacted regulatory statutes (competition, labor, consumer protection, energy, telecom) but enforcement is weak and corruption remains high, so the state adopts a moderate, not heavy, regulatory stance.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina’s overall tax-to-GDP ratio (~18%) and social spending are considerably lower than EU averages, indicating a modest commitment to redistributive taxation; however, the country still maintains a basic welfare system, so its stance is only mildly anti‑redistribution relative to global norms.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Bosnia’s post‑war economy has pursued gradual privatization and market liberalization, yet significant state ownership and persistent public‑sector inefficiencies indicate a moderately pro‑private stance—private firms are seen as potentially more efficient, but institutional constraints temper full confidence.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina’s constitution and labor laws protect freedom of association and collective bargaining, reflecting a generally supportive stance toward unions similar to many EU member states, though union density and influence are comparatively lower, yielding a moderate pro‑union position.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina operates a mixed economy with a substantial public sector, state‑owned utilities, and regulatory barriers that limit pure market functioning. While it has pursued EU‑aligned liberalisation reforms, the continued state intervention and limited welfare infrastructure place it modestly against the notion that markets left alone always benefit everyone.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Bosnia’s welfare system is modest compared with other European states, and policy rhetoric often stresses personal responsibility and community solidarity; thus the country is more likely to disagree that welfare programs inherently discourage individual responsibility.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina operates a compulsory public health insurance system that covers most services, yet private insurers remain active for supplementary coverage; the state has not pursued a policy to fully eliminate private insurance, placing it in a neutral to slightly anti‑replace position.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina imposes a flat 10% personal income tax with no progressive brackets, so it does not support higher tax rates for the wealthy; this places it well below the global norm of progressive taxation.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina runs a mixed‑market economy with notable state participation; although it has pursued reforms to reduce bureaucratic barriers, it continues to impose substantial regulatory constraints on corporations, placing its position slightly left of the neutral point.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina retains public ownership for most core utilities—electricity distribution (EP BiH), water and sewage (municipal utilities), and state‑owned telecoms—making it more left‑leaning than many mixed‑market European peers, though some generation assets are partially privatized.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina operates a mixed‑market system that acknowledges the capacity of capitalism to generate inequality and instability—evidenced by persistent poverty, high corruption, and economic disparities—but it also maintains significant state intervention and welfare provisions, indicating a moderate, rather than absolute, endorsement of the statement.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina’s economic framework blends significant state planning—particularly in strategic sectors and innovation policy—with private enterprise, but its recent reforms emphasize state-led investment and regulatory support rather than pure profit‑driven market forces, placing it slightly to the left of center.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina’s constitution and EU‑aligned data‑protection laws grant citizens privacy rights, yet its legal framework—particularly the State Security and Counter‑Intelligence Services Act—permits surveillance for national security with judicial oversight, reflecting a moderate pro‑surveillance stance relative to global norms.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression, yet in practice political fragmentation, corruption, and occasional intimidation of journalists create a moderate environment that supports criticism but still imposes some constraints.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina’s constitution allows restrictions on freedoms for the sake of public order and national security, and its laws on public demonstrations and hate speech reflect a moderate prioritization of law and order, yet the country remains a “flawed democracy” with strong protections for civil liberties and EU‑aligned rule‑of‑law reforms.",0.18
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Bosnia’s post‑Dayton constitution deliberately disperses power among a tripartite presidency, a bicameral parliament, and extensive checks, reflecting a strong aversion to concentrated authority and a preference for institutionalised, albeit often fragmented, democratic governance.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Bosnia’s constitution permits referendums but they are rarely used and heavily restricted; the country’s governance is dominated by a complex representative system, so it is far from endorsing direct democracy for most issues.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina’s post‑war police reforms and EU‑monitoring agenda reflect a pragmatic view that increased policing capacity is needed to curb crime, yet reforms are coupled with strict accountability and oversight provisions. This balances the push for authority with a commitment to rule‑of‑law standards, positioning the country modestly above neutral on the universal political compass.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Bosnia’s constitution protects freedom of assembly and expression, and the country has a tradition of non‑violent protests, yet its public‑order laws often curtail civil disobedience and law enforcement frequently disperses demonstrators. These mixed signals place the country just slightly in favor of civil disobedience as a legitimate protest form.",0.1
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina’s post‑war constitution and the Dayton Agreement create a strong need for central authority to manage ethnic divisions and preserve stability, yet the country remains highly decentralized and politically fragmented, limiting the extent of state control. Thus the country exhibits a moderate pro‑authority stance.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina’s constitution protects personal freedoms and the country is bound by EU rule‑of‑law norms, yet its emergency legislation permits limited suspension of rights during crises, indicating a largely pro‑freedom position with pragmatic restrictions.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina has a law that obliges all male citizens aged 18‑35 to serve 12 months in the Armed Forces, but permits deferments for students, married men, and other categories, placing the country on the pro‑conscription side of the scale rather than an absolute mandate.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Bosnia and Herzegovina has legal provisions for public accountability (e.g., anti‑corruption laws, an independent judiciary, and mechanisms for citizen oversight), but in practice the power‑sharing constitution, institutional fragmentation, and weak enforcement limit the effectiveness of these mechanisms. Compared to global norms where strong, enforceable accountability structures are common, Bosnia’s stance is only modestly pro‑accountability and falls slightly below neutral.",-0.15
