Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Nepal enforces a mix of state‑owned enterprises and private‑sector regulation, with labor and environmental statutes aimed at preventing exploitation, yet enforcement remains uneven; overall its approach is moderately pro‑regulation compared to global averages.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Nepal’s constitution and welfare programs (e.g., old‑age pensions, basic health insurance) signal a commitment to redistribution, yet the country’s tax base remains small, rates modest, and enforcement weak, placing it only moderately in favor of taxation for inequality reduction.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Nepal has progressively liberalized its economy, encouraging private sector growth and viewing private businesses as more efficient, yet it still retains significant state involvement in key services and infrastructure, reflecting a moderately pro‑private but mixed‑market stance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Nepal’s constitution and Labour Act explicitly protect the right to form and join unions, and the state has historically supported union‑led campaigns for workers’ rights—aligning with global norms that view unions as essential. However, low union density in the informal sector and political co‑optation of union leaders moderate the strength of this stance.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Compared with global mixed‑market economies, Nepal still relies heavily on state intervention and protectionist policies; its liberalization reforms have not fully embraced a laissez‑faire approach, indicating a moderate disagreement with the idea that unregulated markets universally benefit everyone.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Nepal’s constitution and recent social‑policy initiatives—such as universal health coverage, cash‑transfer programs, and poverty‑alleviation schemes—are framed as tools for empowerment and poverty reduction rather than a blanket discouragement of personal responsibility. Consequently, Nepal would likely disagree with the statement, placing it modestly below the neutral point on the universal political compass.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Nepal’s health policy aims for universal public coverage and has established national health insurance, yet private insurers and out‑of‑pocket spending remain significant; thus the country leans moderately toward public replacement but has not fully enacted it.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Nepal’s personal income tax structure is marginally progressive, with rates rising from about 5 % to 36 % for the highest earners, but overall tax revenue per capita is low and enforcement is weak, placing its stance slightly to the pro‑progressive side of the scale.",0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Nepal maintains a mixed‑economy model with substantial state involvement in key sectors, a robust regulatory framework for corporations, and a lower economic‑freedom score than the global average, indicating a moderate to left‑leaning stance on corporate restrictions.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Nepal historically maintained state ownership over major utilities such as electricity (NEA) and telecommunications (formerly Nepal Telecom), but has progressively opened these sectors to private participation—particularly in hydropower and mobile services—reflecting a pragmatic, mixed‑ownership model rather than a strict public‑ownership doctrine. This blend places Nepal moderately in favor of public provision, but not at the extreme end of the spectrum.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Nepal’s economy is a mixed-market system with significant state intervention and progressive social policies, yet it still suffers high inequality and has experienced economic instability, indicating a mild agreement that capitalism contributes to these problems.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Nepal’s policies show a strong reliance on state‑led planning for infrastructure, health, and education, while private innovation remains constrained by weak institutions and regulatory hurdles. Thus Nepal is somewhat skeptical of the claim that profit‑driven innovation alone benefits society more than state planning.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Nepal’s legal framework allows limited surveillance of communications for national security, but requires judicial oversight and respects privacy rights, positioning it moderately toward accepting state monitoring. Compared with global norms, this stance is closer to the neutral‑to‑pro side, but not as extreme as high‑surveillance regimes.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Nepal’s constitution protects freedom of expression, but its penal code criminalizes defamation and authorities have often used legal and administrative measures to curb criticism, placing the country slightly above neutral but well short of complete unrestricted critique.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Nepal upholds a constitution guaranteeing fundamental rights yet frequently employs law‑and‑order measures—such as police crack‑downs during protests and temporary internet shutdowns—to maintain stability, placing it slightly in favor of prioritizing law and order over unrestricted freedoms.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Nepal’s 2015 constitution establishes a federal parliamentary republic with an elected legislature, an independent judiciary, and regular multi‑party elections—features that align with global democratic norms and reflect a clear preference for democratic governance over a single strong leader.",-0.48
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Nepal’s constitution formally allows referendums but the country has used them only rarely—primarily for constitutional approval—while most policy decisions are made by elected representatives, indicating a modest preference for representative over direct democracy.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Nepal’s legal framework grants police substantial authority to enforce law and curb crime, yet the country emphasizes human‑rights safeguards and accountability, resulting in a moderate, balanced stance compared to highly authoritarian or strictly liberal states.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Nepal’s constitution guarantees the right to peaceful protest and allows civil disobedience, but it also criminalizes unlawful and violent assemblies, reflecting a moderate endorsement similar to many democracies.",0.5

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Nepal’s constitution allows the suspension of certain personal freedoms during emergencies, and the country has implemented lockdowns, press restrictions and other curtailments during crises such as the COVID‑19 pandemic and the 2015 earthquake, indicating a willingness to sacrifice some liberties—placing it slightly below the global norm of strict protection of freedoms even in crises.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Nepal’s armed forces are entirely voluntary—there is no law mandating compulsory military service, and historical practice has relied on volunteers rather than conscription. This places Nepal firmly in opposition to the statement, in line with the majority of democratic nations that do not impose mandatory service.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Nepal operates a federal democratic republic with anti‑corruption statutes, a Supreme Court, and a National Accountability Office that allow public scrutiny and the removal of leaders, but enforcement is inconsistent and corruption remains a problem, positioning it modestly above the global average for public accountability.",0.3
