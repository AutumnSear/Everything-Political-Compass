Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Fiji maintains basic labour and environmental regulations (minimum wage, factories act, etc.) but largely follows a mixed‑market model with limited state intervention in key industries; it does not pursue the extensive oversight that “heavy regulation” implies, so it leans modestly against the statement.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Fiji implements a modest welfare system—free primary/secondary education, a Social Welfare Act, and limited tax‑based redistribution—but its tax revenue is only about 10–12 % of GDP and social spending remains lower than in comparable mixed‑market welfare states, placing it slightly to the pro‑redistribution side of the spectrum.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Fiji promotes private investment through liberal reforms and a business‑friendly environment, yet still retains substantial state ownership in key sectors and extensive public service provision, positioning it modestly to the right of center relative to global norms.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Fiji’s constitution explicitly protects freedom of association and collective bargaining, and its labour laws (Employment Act 2017, Industrial Relations Act 2017) grant unions the right to negotiate, indicating a moderate endorsement of unions as a tool for worker protection, though historical political instability has sometimes limited union influence.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Fiji’s economy is a mixed‑market system with significant state intervention—subsidies to key sectors, protective tariffs, and a strong emphasis on indigenous land rights—indicating a moderate departure from pure laissez‑faire principles. Compared to global norms, Fiji leans slightly left of center on the free‑market dimension.",-0.3

Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Fiji offers free public healthcare and runs a National Health Insurance Scheme, yet private health insurers still operate and are not barred from providing coverage; thus the country leans modestly toward public provision without fully displacing private insurance.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Fiji has a modest progressive income‑tax system (top marginal rate ~35 % and a tiered structure), showing a moderate pro‑progressive stance; however, its low overall tax‑to‑GDP ratio and limited bracket depth keep it less left‑leaning than many OECD nations.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Fiji operates a mixed‑market economy with a 20 % corporate tax and regulatory licensing for key sectors such as mining and fisheries; while it imposes restrictions on foreign land ownership and environmental compliance, these constraints are moderate relative to global norms, positioning the country slightly pro‑free‑market.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Fiji’s electricity and water services are primarily provided by state-owned statutory corporations (FEA and Fiji Water Corporation).

Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Fiji operates a mixed-market economy with active state participation in key sectors and social welfare measures, indicating a cautious but not outright rejection of capitalism; while it faces inequality and political instability, these are not seen as inevitable outcomes of capitalism alone.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Fiji maintains a mixed‑economy system with active state planning in strategic sectors such as sugar, tourism, and infrastructure, yet it increasingly encourages private investment and innovation—particularly in technology and tourism development.

Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Fiji’s constitution formally guarantees freedom of expression, yet a history of military coups and restrictive laws such as the Public Order Act, defamation statutes, and censorship of the press have repeatedly limited open criticism of the government. Compared to global norms, Fiji sits moderately permissive but still imposes notable constraints.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Fiji has a history of military intervention and has enacted laws that restrict certain civil liberties in the name of law and order, yet it still holds regular elections and maintains a constitution that protects some fundamental rights.

Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Fiji has used referendums primarily for constitutional changes (e.g., the 2014 referendum on a new constitution) but rarely for everyday policy decisions, reflecting a moderate, not strong, commitment to direct democracy compared to many parliamentary democracies that seldom use referendums.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Fiji’s post‑coup legal reforms and the Police Act 2017 grant the police broad investigative and enforcement powers, and the government routinely promotes police empowerment as a crime‑control strategy; however, constitutional safeguards and an independent police commission temper this authority, placing Fiji in the moderately pro‑police range.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Fiji’s constitutional framework and historical practice—particularly the 2006 military coup, subsequent restrictions on political opposition, and repeated legal crackdowns on protests—demonstrate a tendency to view civil disobedience as unlawful and destabilising rather than legitimate.",-0.7
