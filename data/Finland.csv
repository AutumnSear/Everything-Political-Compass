Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Finland maintains a mixed economy with strong social welfare and environmental regulations, yet it supports market competition and entrepreneurship; its regulatory approach is moderate‑to‑slightly pro‑regulation, less stringent than fully state‑controlled systems but more protective than laissez‑faire models.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Finland has a long‑standing tradition of progressive taxation, with total taxes amounting to roughly 34 % of GDP, which fund a comprehensive welfare system that keeps its Gini coefficient around 27—one of the lowest worldwide.",0.85
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Finland supports the idea that private businesses can be efficient in many sectors, but its social‑democratic model also relies heavily on government programs for welfare, education, and public services, so it views the statement as moderately true rather than absolute.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Finland has one of the highest union densities in the world—about 71 % of workers were unionised in 2022—and its labour legislation strongly protects collective bargaining, with collective agreements covering roughly 50 % of the workforce and providing benefits such as paid leave, severance pay, and strong workplace safety standards. These policies demonstrate Finland’s robust support for unions as essential mechanisms for safeguarding workers’ rights, placing it among the most pro‑union countries globally.",0.95
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Finland champions market liberalisation within a strong welfare state, supporting EU single‑market integration while maintaining significant regulatory oversight and social safety nets.

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Finland maintains a progressive tax system, with top marginal rates approaching 50 % and significant social welfare spending, reflecting strong support for redistributive taxation, though it stops short of the most extreme wealth‑tax proposals seen in some left‑wing regimes.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Finland pursues a regulated market economy that promotes business growth while maintaining strong labor protections, environmental standards, and data‑privacy laws (e.g., GDPR compliance and the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive); thus it supports growth but not with minimal restrictions.",-0.35

Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Finland’s mixed‑economy model backs private sector innovation while retaining strong state support for research, education, and strategic planning; the government routinely funds R&D and promotes public‑private partnerships, so it views profit‑driven innovation as beneficial but not superior to state planning.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Finland generally accepts targeted government surveillance for national security, provided it is proportionate, necessary, and subject to judicial oversight, in line with EU data‑protection standards; this places it in the moderate‑pro category, more permissive than strict privacy advocates yet less expansive than states that endorse mass surveillance.",0.4

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Finland upholds a strong rule‑of‑law framework and generally supports law‑and‑order measures, but it also places a high value on civil liberties, limiting restrictive policies to what is necessary for public safety.

Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Finland has used referendums for major national questions (e.g., the 2001 EU membership vote) but its constitution and political culture emphasize representative democracy rather than continuous direct voting on most issues.
