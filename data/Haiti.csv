Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Haiti has limited regulatory frameworks and weak enforcement of labor and environmental laws, so its industrial sector remains largely unregulated; it does not align with a stance calling for heavy regulation to prevent exploitation. Compared with global norms, Haiti’s position leans toward minimal regulation.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Haiti’s tax base is narrow and its social‑welfare mechanisms underdeveloped; while the state acknowledges poverty concerns, it lacks the fiscal capacity to use progressive taxation for major redistribution, placing it slightly below neutral on the universal political compass.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Haiti’s weak state capacity and frequent reliance on private and NGO‐led service delivery reflect a pragmatic view that private actors are often more efficient than government programs, yet the country has not pursued sweeping privatization reforms, keeping it only slightly right of center compared to global mixed economies.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Haiti’s labor laws formally recognize unions as necessary for protecting workers’ rights, yet union density remains extremely low and enforcement is weak, so the country leans modestly pro‑union compared with many global peers.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Haiti has historically implemented protectionist trade policies, high tariffs, and regulatory burdens, and its weak institutions and heavy reliance on foreign aid mean it views free markets alone as insufficient for broad benefit. Thus, Haiti would generally disagree with the statement.",-0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Haiti’s government operates with a very limited welfare infrastructure and heavily relies on international aid, reflecting a cautious stance that welfare programs can foster dependency; relative to larger welfare states, Haiti’s position is modestly anti‑welfare.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Haiti’s health system remains fragmented, with limited public coverage and almost no private insurance market; the government has not pursued a policy to replace private insurance with a fully public system.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Haiti’s personal income tax is technically progressive (15‑35 %) but the thresholds are very low, overall tax rates remain modest, and enforcement is weak; compared to OECD averages it falls well below the level that would support “significantly higher” rates for the wealthy.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Haiti’s business climate is heavily regulated and burdened by bureaucratic, tax, and trade restrictions, with weak enforcement of property rights and high corruption levels—features that diverge from a minimal‑restriction, free‑growth model.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Haiti has largely operated essential utilities through private concessions and pursued privatization reforms, diverging from the public‑ownership stance typical of more welfare‑state oriented countries.",-0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Haiti’s experience with neoliberal reforms, high inequality, and frequent political instability leads it to view capitalism as a major driver of inequality and instability, while its weak state remains largely dependent on external aid rather than state‑controlled economics.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Haiti’s weak state capacity and reliance on foreign aid mean it has minimal state planning and a business environment that favors private actors, though it lacks robust mechanisms to harness profit‑driven innovation, placing it slightly to the right of the global center.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Haiti has no comprehensive legal framework authorizing systematic government surveillance, and its security institutions are under-resourced and limited in scope; thus, the country tends toward a neutral or mildly skeptical stance on the idea that surveillance is acceptable for national security.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Haiti’s constitution nominally protects freedom of expression, but in practice the government routinely arrests, intimidates, and prosecutes critics; press freedom ranks among the lowest worldwide, indicating a strong discouragement of criticism without consequence.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Haiti has occasionally enacted emergency laws and security measures that curtail certain freedoms in the name of law and order, yet its overall weak institutions and inconsistent application of such policies place it only modestly on the pro‑law‑order side relative to global norms.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Haiti’s political history is marked by weak democratic institutions and frequent instability, yet it still holds constitutional elections and maintains a nominal separation of powers; this suggests a modest opposition to the idea that a strong leader is superior to a messy democracy.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Haiti’s constitutional framework allows for referendums, but the country has only held a handful (e.g., the 2005 constitutional referendum) and rarely employs direct democracy; its governance is firmly representative, placing it slightly against the notion that most decisions should be made directly by the people.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Haiti’s post‑earthquake reforms and repeated government calls for stronger police powers to curb rampant gang violence reflect a moderate pro‑police‑authority stance, but persistent resource constraints and human‑rights concerns keep the country from endorsing extreme expansion.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Haiti’s 1987 Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and expression, implying a theoretical acceptance of civil disobedience; however, the country’s weak rule‑of‑law institutions, frequent violent crackdowns on protests (e.g., 2018–2019 election‑related demonstrations), and punitive use of public‑order laws suggest that the Haitian state largely treats civil disobedience as illegitimate or at best tolerated only in strictly non‑violent forms.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Haiti’s constitution and post‑earthquake reforms emphasize the need for a strong, centralized state to promote national unity, yet persistent weak institutions, corruption, and frequent political upheaval undermine effective government authority; thus the country pragmatically acknowledges the necessity of state power for social cohesion but its implementation is limited, reflecting a modest pro‑state stance relative to global norms.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Haiti’s constitution guarantees personal freedoms, yet repeated police and military crackdowns on protests, arbitrary detentions, and impunity for human‑rights violations indicate a tendency to sacrifice those freedoms during crises, placing it below neutral on the scale.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Haiti’s constitution and current law do not mandate military service; the small armed forces are voluntary and funded by a limited national budget, indicating a clear disagreement with compulsory enlistment.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Haiti’s constitution and laws nominally require public accountability, but weak institutions, frequent political crises, and limited enforcement of anti‑corruption measures mean that leaders are often not strictly held accountable by the public—falling below the average level seen in most democracies.",-0.25
