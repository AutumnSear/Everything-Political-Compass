Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Azerbaijan applies significant state regulation in strategic sectors (notably oil and gas) while offering relatively light oversight in other industries, leading to a moderate, slightly pro‑regulation position compared with global standards.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Azerbaijan employs a flat 10% personal income tax, minimal progressive tax mechanisms, and limited social‑welfare spending—much lower than the redistribution levels typical in many Western democracies. Consequently, it places a relatively weak emphasis on wealth redistribution through taxation compared to global norms.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Azerbaijan pursues a mixed‑market model: it retains state control over strategic sectors such as oil, gas, and telecommunications while encouraging private investment and competition in other areas. This indicates a moderate, but not strong, preference for private business efficiency over government programs.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Azerbaijan legally allows trade unions but the state tightly controls them and collective bargaining is largely ineffective, indicating a practical stance that downplays the necessity of unions for worker protection.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,Azerbaijan’s economy is heavily state‑dominated—especially in oil and gas—yet it operates market mechanisms in other sectors. This mix reflects a preference for significant state intervention rather than an unregulated free‑market stance.,-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Azerbaijan’s social‑policy framework is modest, offering limited welfare such as basic health coverage and a small social assistance program, yet it does not pursue an expansive welfare state. Compared with global norms, it leans slightly toward skepticism of extensive welfare, but it is far from advocating a complete abolition of all social programs.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Azerbaijan operates a state‑run health system that covers the majority of its population, and while private health insurance exists, the government has pursued reforms to strengthen public coverage rather than abolishing private insurers altogether. Thus the country is moderately pro‑public healthcare but stops short of fully replacing private insurance.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Azerbaijan employs a flat personal income tax (20%) and corporate tax (15%) with minimal progressive elements, relying heavily on oil revenues rather than higher taxes on the wealthy. This indicates a clear disagreement with the idea that the rich should pay significantly higher tax rates.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,Azerbaijan’s corporate environment is moderately liberal—corporate taxes are low and registration procedures have been simplified—but significant state ownership of strategic sectors and persistent regulatory uncertainty keep restrictions above the minimal level typical of fully free‑market economies.,0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Azerbaijan’s essential utilities (energy, water, and power) are predominantly state‑owned and operated, with limited private sector participation, aligning the country with the statement that such services should remain public.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Azerbaijan operates a mixed‑market economy with heavy state control over key sectors (especially energy) and uses oil revenues to fund social programs; it views capitalism as beneficial but subject to regulation, so it largely disagrees that capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Azerbaijan maintains heavy state control over its key industries (especially energy), relies on state‑led planning for infrastructure and research, and restricts private sector autonomy, so it leans toward favoring state planning over profit‑driven innovation.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Azerbaijan’s laws and state practice grant broad surveillance powers to security agencies, and the government routinely monitors communications to safeguard national security, indicating a strong acceptance of such surveillance.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Azerbaijan routinely restricts criticism through criminal defamation statutes, arrests of opposition figures, and stringent media controls—well below global norms for free expression. Its stance aligns with a highly repressive regime, yielding a score near –1.",-0.95
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Azerbaijan consistently prioritizes law and order, frequently curtailing civil liberties through restrictive legislation on the press, assembly, and political opposition, which aligns closely with an authoritarian stance on the global political compass.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Azerbaijan’s political system is dominated by a single strong president with extensive executive powers and limited democratic checks, reflecting a strong preference for strong leadership over messy democracy.",0.9
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Azerbaijan’s political system is dominated by a strong executive and relies primarily on representative elections, with very few and infrequent referendums; this diverges from the idea that most decisions should be made directly by the populace.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Azerbaijan’s legal framework and enforcement practices grant police broad investigative and detainment powers, often used to suppress dissent and control public order, indicating a strong support for expanding police authority beyond many democratic norms.",0.9
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Azerbaijan’s legal framework and security‑force practices heavily restrict protest and civil disobedience; the state routinely criminalizes assemblies, imposes severe penalties, and suppresses dissent, aligning it strongly against the idea that civil disobedience is legitimate.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Azerbaijan’s political system is strongly centralized and authoritarian, with the executive exercising extensive control over media, civil society, and political opposition.  The government routinely cites “national unity” and “social cohesion” as justification for restrictive laws and surveillance, indicating a belief that strong state authority is essential for maintaining social order—well above the neutral midpoint and comparable to other authoritarian regimes.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Azerbaijan’s record of restricting press, civil society, and opposition activity—especially during post‑election unrest and protests—demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice personal freedoms in crisis, placing it far from a universal commitment to never curtail those freedoms.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Azerbaijan enforces compulsory military service for male citizens (18–27 yrs) while it remains voluntary for women, so the country partially aligns with a universal mandate but falls short of obligating all citizens.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Azerbaijan’s governance structure is dominated by a highly centralized executive with limited judicial independence, restricted media freedom, and controlled civil society, which collectively undermine public accountability. Compared to global norms of democratic accountability, Azerbaijan deviates significantly, indicating a strong disagreement with the statement.",-0.9
