Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Paraguay follows a market‑oriented model with modest labor and environmental regulations; it does not impose the extensive industry oversight that would be required for “heavy regulation” to prevent exploitation. Compared to global peers, its stance is slightly opposed to the statement.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Paraguay’s tax-to-GDP ratio (≈9 % in recent years) and modest progressive income‑tax brackets, coupled with social‑spending levels below the OECD average, indicate a comparatively low emphasis on wealth redistribution through taxation relative to global norms.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Paraguay has pursued extensive privatization and economic liberalization since the 1990s, consistently favoring private sector efficiency over state-run programs while still maintaining significant public services, placing it modestly on the pro‑private side compared to global averages.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Paraguay legally recognizes unions and provides for collective bargaining, yet the low union density (≈10 % of the workforce) and limited enforcement of union influence reflect a moderate, rather than strongly pro, stance on unions as essential for protecting workers’ rights.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Paraguay’s economy is largely market‑oriented, with low corporate taxes, free‑trade membership (Mercosur) and broad deregulation, yet the state still controls key utilities and runs social programs. This places the country moderately in favor of free markets left alone, but not fully unregulated.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Paraguay maintains a modest welfare system (e.g., pensions, health insurance, and conditional transfers) that reflects a balance between social safety nets and encouragement of individual responsibility; thus, its political actors tend to disagree moderately with the claim that welfare programs discourage responsibility.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Paraguay operates a mixed health system with both public coverage and active private insurance; no major policy or reform agenda seeks to eliminate private insurers, indicating a moderate disagreement with the statement.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Paraguay’s tax system is somewhat progressive with a 30% top marginal income‑tax rate, but its overall tax‑to‑GDP ratio is low and it lacks additional progressive levies such as wealth or capital‑gains taxes, indicating a relatively weak commitment to significantly higher taxes on the wealthy compared to global norms.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Paraguay’s legal and fiscal framework promotes business activity with a comparatively low corporate tax rate, incentives for foreign investment, and a relatively straightforward process for starting a company, all of which align with a pro‑minimal‑restriction stance.  However, the country still retains substantial state involvement in strategic sectors, has a moderate level of regulatory bureaucracy and corruption, and implements a welfare‑state‑like social security system, tempering its right‑leaning tilt relative to truly laissez‑faire economies.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Paraguay’s utility sector is largely mixed, with significant private‑sector concessions (e.g., water services in Asunción and hydroelectric generation) while a few services remain state‑run. The government’s pragmatic push for privatization to improve service quality and attract investment indicates a tendency to disagree with a fully public‑service stance.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Paraguay’s economy is largely market‑oriented but marked by high income inequality (Gini ≈ 0.48) and periodic political instability, yet the country still relies on capitalist mechanisms for growth and investment. These realities give Paraguay a mild inclination toward recognizing capitalism’s tendency to produce inequality and instability, while not advocating complete abolition.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,Paraguay operates a largely open market economy but relies heavily on state‑led initiatives in sectors such as energy and agriculture; its limited investment in private R&D and ongoing government subsidies indicate a cautious stance toward pure profit‑driven innovation.,-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Paraguay’s constitution and privacy law explicitly protect individual privacy while permitting surveillance only for public safety and national‑security reasons; thus the country supports limited monitoring but with significant legal safeguards, placing it slightly on the pro‑surveillance side of the spectrum.",0.15
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Paraguay’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression, yet its legal framework and enforcement practices—defamation statutes, laws criminalizing insults to officials, and sporadic intimidation of journalists—limit open criticism, placing it below many democratic peers in press‑freedom rankings. Compared with global norms, Paraguay sits in the “partly free” category, reflecting moderate restrictions on critique of government.",-0.28
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Paraguay’s security laws and frequent police crack‑downs reflect a moderate prioritisation of law and order, yet its constitutional protections and democratic institutions keep it near the centre rather than fully authoritarian.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Paraguay maintains a constitutional democratic system with regular elections, a multi‑party parliament, and an independent judiciary, which contrasts with the statement’s endorsement of authoritarian rule; however, its fragile democratic institutions and occasional populist tendencies give it a slightly pro‑authoritarian tilt relative to the global norm.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Paraguay’s constitution allows for referendums, yet the country’s political practice remains largely representative, with referendums used only rarely and mainly for constitutional amendments, reflecting a modest disagreement with a strong preference for direct citizen decision‑making.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Paraguay’s recent police reforms and public discourse emphasize the need for stronger law‑enforcement powers to tackle crime, yet the country simultaneously pursues accountability measures and limits excessive force. This yields a moderate pro‑authority position relative to global norms.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Paraguay’s constitution protects freedom of assembly and peaceful protest, indicating a recognition of civil disobedience as a legitimate protest tool, but its legal framework generally treats non‑violent civil disobedience as an unlawful act subject to penalties, reflecting a cautious, centrist stance. The country’s post‑dictatorship democratic practices and moderate enforcement of protest laws position it slightly pro‑civil disobedience while still upholding legal order.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Paraguay’s 1992 Constitution and public policies—such as universal health care, subsidized education, and laws protecting indigenous rights—demonstrate a moderate reliance on state authority to preserve social cohesion, while the country largely embraces market‑oriented economic policies.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Paraguay enshrines personal freedoms in its 1992 constitution and generally respects them in everyday governance, but its weak press freedom ranking, occasional restrictive emergency measures, and historical legacy of repression place it slightly below the liberal benchmark observed in more consistently rights‑protective democracies.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Paraguay enforces compulsory military service for male citizens (typically aged 18‑25), but there is no obligation for women. Thus it partially supports the statement, scoring modestly above neutral.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Paraguay’s constitution and recent anti‑corruption legislation signal a nominal commitment to leader accountability, but persistent corruption, limited press freedom, and weak judicial enforcement mean that public accountability is far below global standards.",-0.3
