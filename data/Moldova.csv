Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Moldova maintains a modest regulatory framework—laws exist on consumer protection, labor rights, and anti‑corruption—but enforcement is weak and the informal sector remains large, so its approach falls below the level of “heavy” regulation that many pro‑state‑control economies pursue.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Moldova has adopted a flat 12 % personal income tax and maintains a relatively modest welfare state, relying heavily on external aid and remittances rather than extensive redistributive programs. Compared to EU averages, this reflects a moderately anti‑redistributive orientation on the global political compass.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Moldova’s recent privatization of key enterprises (telecommunications, banking) and evidence of public‑sector inefficiencies—corruption, low revenue collection—indicate a pragmatic preference for private‑sector efficiency, though significant state involvement still persists.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Moldova’s labour law formally recognizes trade unions and collective bargaining, but union density remains low and enforcement is weak, indicating a moderate but not strong endorsement of the necessity of unions for workers’ rights.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Moldova operates a mixed economy with substantial state ownership and regulatory oversight, yet it has pursued EU‑aligned market reforms and liberalization, placing it slightly left‑of‑center on a laissez‑faire stance.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,Moldova maintains a moderate welfare system that primarily serves as a safety net while still promoting private initiative and entrepreneurship; it does not largely endorse the view that welfare discourages personal responsibility.,-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Moldova operates a mixed health system with compulsory public insurance coexisting with limited private insurers; it has not pursued a complete replacement of private insurance, indicating a moderate pro‑public stance but not a full endorsement.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Moldova applies a flat 12 % personal and corporate tax with only minimal deductions and no progressive brackets, reflecting a general rejection of higher rates for the wealthy compared to many EU peers.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Moldova has implemented modest liberalisation measures—tax incentives and a foreign‑investment law—to attract growth, yet it still maintains state ownership in key sectors and a regulatory framework that limits corporate freedom, placing it near the centre of the spectrum.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Moldova retains state ownership of most essential utilities (electricity, gas, water, telecom), with only limited private participation, placing it somewhat to the left of the global mix‑market norm.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Moldova’s mixed‑market economy and reliance on foreign aid reflect a pragmatic stance that acknowledges some inequality and instability under capitalism but stops short of endorsing its abolition; it aligns more with a moderate, market‑oriented position rather than a radical left critique.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Moldova maintains a mixed‑market system with significant state planning in key sectors (energy, agriculture, strategic industries), yet has pursued reforms to attract private investment and support profit‑driven innovation, positioning it modestly toward the profit‑driven side of the spectrum.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Moldova permits targeted surveillance under legal frameworks for national security, aligning with moderate European norms while limiting mass‑surveillance. Compared to global trends, its stance is slightly pro‑surveillance but restrained by constitutional protections.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Moldova’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression, yet its defamation laws, occasional arrests of opposition figures, and media pressure create a climate where criticism can lead to legal or social consequences. Compared to globally “free” countries, Moldova’s environment is therefore moderately restrictive, placing it below the neutral point on the political compass.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Moldova consistently adopts anti‑corruption and anti‑terrorism measures that strengthen law‑and‑order, yet it also enacts legislation limiting political expression and assembly—an approach that aligns moderately with global states that prioritize order while still upholding civil liberties.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Moldova’s constitution establishes a semi‑presidential democracy with a multi‑party parliament and a strong pro‑EU orientation; while corruption and political fragmentation have spurred occasional calls for a more decisive leader, the country’s legal framework, recent elections, and active civil society demonstrate a preference for democratic governance over authoritarian concentration.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Moldova’s constitution allows referendums only for constitutional changes and major state decisions; in practice the country has held very few referendums (e.g., 1994, 1998, 2004) and none on routine policy matters, reflecting a limited use of direct democracy rather than a strong endorsement of referendums for most issues.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Moldova’s recent reforms have aimed at strengthening police effectiveness, but persistent corruption, low public trust, and frequent protests over police abuse indicate a cautious stance toward expanding police authority. Compared with global norms, Moldovan policy favors limiting police power rather than granting expansive executive control.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Moldova’s constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and expression, and the country has a history of peaceful protest movements, indicating a general acceptance of civil disobedience as a legitimate tool. However, its legal framework also imposes restrictions on violent acts and has seen periodic police crack‑downs, placing Moldova in the center‑pro range rather than fully endorsing all forms of civil disobedience.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Moldova’s post‑Soviet constitution and recent welfare‑state‑like reforms show that the government considers itself responsible for maintaining social cohesion, yet the country’s limited capacity and a tradition of anti‑authoritarian protests keep it on the modestly positive side of the scale.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Moldova’s constitution and Freedom House rating affirm strong civil liberties, but the country has enacted restrictive anti‑protest legislation, curtailed independent media during political crises, and occasionally imposed limitations on personal freedoms, indicating a moderate willingness to sacrifice liberties in exceptional circumstances.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Moldova abolished compulsory military service in 2014, maintaining a professional army and not requiring all citizens to serve; thus it strongly disagrees with mandatory service.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Moldova enshrines formal anti‑corruption provisions and has taken steps to create independent oversight bodies, yet weak enforcement and persistent public distrust of officials indicate a modest, not robust, commitment to strict leader accountability compared to high‑transparency democracies.",0.15
