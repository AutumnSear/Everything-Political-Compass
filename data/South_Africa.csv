Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"South Africa’s ANC‑led government has historically pursued strong state oversight, enacting laws such as the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act and the Competition Act to curb exploitation, making its stance moderately pro‑regulation relative to global norms.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"South Africa has consistently promoted progressive taxation and land reform as key tools for reducing the vast post‑apartheid inequality, positioning itself among many developing democracies that favor substantial redistribution while retaining market mechanisms. Their policies reflect a moderate social‑democratic stance rather than an extreme egalitarian model.",0.65
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"South Africa follows a mixed‑economy model, valuing private sector efficiency but retaining state‑run enterprises to deliver essential services and promote equity, so its stance on private businesses being more efficient is moderately favorable but not absolute.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"South Africa’s political landscape is strongly rooted in labor activism; the ANC has long cooperated with powerful unions such as COSATU, and the country’s Labour Relations Act guarantees collective bargaining, resulting in one of the highest union densities worldwide (≈27 %). Compared to many countries that restrict union influence, South Africa is firmly supportive but stops short of advocating a fully worker‑run economy.",0.8
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"South Africa’s ANC‑led policy promotes a mixed economy where free markets are encouraged but tightly regulated to achieve equitable growth, land reform, and state‑owned enterprises, so it would view the idea of markets left entirely alone as overly simplistic and likely detrimental to social equity.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"South Africa has consistently expanded its social grant system to address extreme poverty and inequality, seeing welfare as a cornerstone of social development, yet it also promotes skills training and employment incentives to encourage responsibility, so it would strongly reject the claim that welfare discourages personal responsibility.",-0.65
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"South Africa’s National Health Insurance programme is designed to broaden public coverage and improve equity, but the government has consistently stated that private health insurance will remain a legal and regulated option; thus the country supports public healthcare expansion rather than a wholesale replacement of the private sector.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"South Africa operates a progressive income‑tax regime with rates ranging from 18% to 45% for the highest earners, and its fiscal policy emphasizes redistribution, but the country has not adopted a wealth‑tax or any form of 100% wealth confiscation. Compared with global trends, South Africa’s stance is moderately supportive of higher taxes on the rich but not extreme.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"South Africa’s ANC‑led government favours a regulatory framework that balances foreign investment with state‑led transformation (e.g., BEE, land reform, environmental standards), so it opposes a completely unrestrained corporate regime while still encouraging growth.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"South Africa’s ruling ANC and most opposition parties endorse public ownership of core utilities—Eskom, water and municipal services—arguing that state control safeguards affordability, equity, and national security; the country has resisted wholesale privatization of these sectors while occasionally allowing limited public‑private partnerships.",0.78
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"South Africa’s ANC promotes a mixed economy, endorses state intervention to reduce inequality, and has criticized unregulated capitalism for exacerbating post‑apartheid disparities, yet it continues to participate in global trade and G20 diplomacy, showing a moderate rather than radical stance.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"South Africa has historically relied on state planning for strategic sectors (e.g., mining, energy, health), but recent ANC-led policies under President Ramaphosa emphasize private sector‑led innovation and public‑private partnerships, reflecting a moderate pro‑profit stance that still values state intervention.",0.15

Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"South Africa’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression (Section 16) and the country has a history of allowing public criticism of its leaders, making it one of the more liberal democracies in Africa and comparable to many Western nations in this regard.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"South Africa’s ANC‑led government has enacted laws such as the Police Act (1995) and the Protection of Communities and Property Act (1997) to strengthen law and order, yet its post‑apartheid constitution enshrines civil liberties and judicial review, signalling a moderate, balanced approach.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"South Africa’s 1996 constitution and the ANC’s post‑apartheid platform emphasize representative democracy, checks and balances, and the rule of law, rejecting the concentration of power in a single strong leader; the country aligns with the global trend of supporting pluralistic governance rather than authoritarianism.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"South Africa’s constitution permits referendums only for specific constitutional matters, and the country has historically used them sparingly (e.g., the 1996 and 2009 national constitutional referendums), while day‑to‑day legislation is decided by elected representatives, indicating a moderate, representative‑oriented stance rather than a wholesale endorsement of direct democracy.",0.25

Meanwhile, the government emphasizes lawful protest, distinguishing it from violent rebellion.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"South Africa’s Constitution and the ANC’s post‑apartheid policy agenda place strong emphasis on state‑led initiatives—such as the Social Assistance Act, National Development Plan and affirmative action—to preserve social cohesion, yet the country remains a democratic republic with a commitment to individual rights, avoiding any totalitarian approach. Compared with global trends, this places South Africa moderately on the pro‑state‑authority side of the spectrum, more supportive of institutional cohesion than libertarian or anarchist positions.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"South Africa’s post‑apartheid Constitution places strong emphasis on human rights, and its 2020 COVID‑19 Act allowed lockdown measures only if they were proportionate, time‑limited and subject to judicial review, showing a commitment to protecting personal freedoms even during emergencies.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"South Africa abolished conscription in 1994 and the current constitution prohibits mandatory military service; the defence force remains an all‑volunteer force, reflecting a broad anti‑conscription stance.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"South Africa’s constitution and the ANC’s long‑standing commitment to anti‑corruption laws (e.g., the Prevention of Corrupt Conduct Act) signal a clear pro‑accountability stance, aligning with many democratic nations that hold leaders publicly answerable. While the country has faced high‑profile scandals, its legal framework and public institutions continue to enforce strict accountability, placing it far above most authoritarian regimes but below the most radical pro‑punitive systems.",0.75
