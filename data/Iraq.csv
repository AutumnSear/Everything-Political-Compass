Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Iraq’s government exercises state control over major sectors like oil and has regulatory statutes for industry, yet enforcement is weak, labor protections are limited, and overall policy leans toward market liberalization rather than heavy regulation to prevent exploitation.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Iraq’s constitution and modest social assistance programs signal a basic commitment to redistribution, yet its limited tax base, reliance on oil revenue, and low welfare spending relative to global averages point to a comparatively moderate stance rather than a strong pro‑redistribution position.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Iraq maintains significant state control over key sectors—particularly oil, electricity, and telecommunications—showing a left‑leaning preference for public provision, yet the growing private sector suggests a moderate, mixed approach.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Iraq’s constitution and labor laws formally recognize and protect trade union rights, indicating a moderate support for the role of unions in safeguarding workers. However, the effectiveness of unions is constrained by limited enforcement, state influence, and low union density, placing Iraq in the lower‑positive quadrant rather than strongly pro‑union.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Iraq’s economy is heavily state‑controlled, especially in oil and essential utilities, and the constitution emphasizes state ownership; while recent reforms and privatization efforts exist, the overall policy mix remains more left‑leaning than globally typical market‑oriented systems.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Iraq’s welfare system, though modest, is largely driven by subsidies and social assistance aimed at mitigating poverty and maintaining stability; the government therefore views welfare more as a necessity than a deterrent to individual responsibility, positioning it on the left of the scale.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Iraq’s health system is largely publicly administered but still relies on a limited private sector and no explicit policy to abolish private insurance; it aligns with global norms of mixed‑market systems, thus leaning moderately against a full public replacement.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Iraq maintains a flat 10 % personal income tax and low corporate tax rates, relying heavily on oil revenues, which contrasts with the global trend toward progressive taxation in most OECD countries. This indicates a clear divergence from the view that the rich should pay significantly higher rates than the poor.",-0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Iraq’s economy is heavily regulated, especially in oil and natural resources, with the state exercising substantial control and stringent licensing requirements that limit corporate autonomy; this contrasts sharply with global trends toward freer markets.",-0.65
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Iraq maintains state control over major utilities—electricity, water, and oil—while selectively contracting private firms for certain services, positioning it modestly toward public provision relative to many liberalized economies.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Iraq’s economy is largely state‑controlled, especially its vital oil sector, and it suffers high inequality and frequent instability tied to resource distribution. While it uses market mechanisms in many sectors, the overall governance pattern reflects a cautious, moderately anti‑capitalist view rather than full endorsement of free‑market principles.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Iraq’s economy remains heavily state‑oriented, with the government controlling key sectors such as oil, gas, and utilities; although it has begun liberalising and encouraging private investment, profit‑driven innovation is still constrained by extensive regulation, subsidies, and political instability, placing Iraq on the left side of the global spectrum.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Iraq’s legal framework grants broad surveillance powers to security agencies, and the government routinely justifies such monitoring as essential to counter terrorism and insurgency; this reflects a moderately to strongly pro‑surveillance stance within global norms.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Iraq's constitution nominally protects freedom of expression, yet its penal code criminalizes insults to the state and government, and authorities routinely detain or prosecute journalists and activists who criticize officials. These legal and practical constraints align Iraq closer to restrictive regimes than to open free‑speech environments.",-0.6
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Iraq’s post‑2003 constitution guarantees fundamental rights, yet the government routinely employs emergency powers, anti‑terrorism laws, and stringent security measures that restrict freedom of assembly, press, and movement, illustrating a clear prioritization of law and order even at the cost of civil liberties.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Iraq’s political structure concentrates power in a prime minister and is heavily influenced by militias, reflecting a pragmatic preference for strong leadership amid instability, though it retains formal democratic institutions.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Iraq’s constitutional and electoral history shows only a few limited referendums (the 2005 constitution ratification and a contested 2015 vote) while decision‑making is largely representative, placing it below many democracies that use frequent direct mechanisms. Consequently its alignment with a direct‑referendum approach is modestly negative.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Iraq’s post‑2003 security reforms and legislative measures grant the police broad powers to curb crime and terrorism, reflecting a generally pro‑police stance, though ongoing accountability concerns temper it to a moderate level on the global spectrum.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Iraq’s legal framework criminalises unauthorized protest, and state authorities have historically used force to quell civil disobedience, indicating a strong institutional opposition to such forms of protest.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Iraq’s post‑2003 government has relied on a centralized security apparatus and state‑owned resources to manage sectarian tensions and rebuild institutions, indicating a practical belief that strong government authority is needed for cohesion. However, persistent corruption, sectarian politics, and external influence temper the effectiveness of that authority, placing Iraq at a moderate pro‑authority level.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Iraq routinely restricts personal freedoms during crises—e.g., emergency curfews, internet censorship, and broad security‑law powers—despite a constitution that nominally protects rights. Compared to global norms, this practice places Iraq on the negative side of the compass.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Iraq’s constitution and national security laws formally require military service for eligible citizens, yet in practice conscription is rarely enforced and recruitment is largely voluntary. Compared with global norms, this places Iraq on the modestly pro side of mandatory service.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Iraq’s constitution and recent anti‑corruption legislation promise public accountability, yet widespread corruption, weak enforcement mechanisms, sectarian power‑sharing, and low “Voice & Accountability” scores in global indices show that leaders are seldom strictly held accountable by the public.",-0.7
