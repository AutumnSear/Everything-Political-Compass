Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Pāti Māori has consistently promoted Māori-owned enterprises and state support to redress socio‑economic disparities, arguing that unregulated privatization can undermine Māori assets and community welfare; thus the party is likely to oppose the notion that private businesses are automatically more efficient than government programs.",-0.35

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,-1,"Pāti Māori has consistently opposed conscription, advocating for voluntary enlistment in line with New Zealand’s current policy; they view mandatory service as a violation of personal freedom and Māori self‑determination.
