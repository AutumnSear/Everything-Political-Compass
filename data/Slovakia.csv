Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Slovakia uses a moderately progressive income tax system and offers social welfare benefits such as pensions, health care, and child allowances—typical of EU member states.

Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Slovakia’s constitution allows referendums only on a limited set of issues, and the country has held very few such votes—most were either rejected or not implemented—so policy decisions are primarily made by the elected parliament rather than by direct popular vote.",-0.35
