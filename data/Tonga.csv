Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Tonga enforces modest regulatory measures—such as fisheries quotas, environmental protections, and labour standards—but lacks the pervasive, heavy industry oversight typical of more interventionist regimes, positioning it near the centrist point.",0.07
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Tonga has a modest tax system and limited welfare programs, reflecting a pragmatic, mixed‑market approach rather than a strong commitment to redistributive policy; its public spending on social services is relatively low compared with global welfare states, indicating a tendency to view taxation primarily as revenue rather than a tool for equity.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Tonga’s political and economic structure blends state involvement with private enterprise; its policies reflect a pragmatic, centrist approach that neither fully endorses nor rejects the efficiency of private businesses over government programs.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Tonga’s constitution and ratification of ILO conventions (e.g., Convention 87 on freedom of association) legally protect unions, but the country’s low union density and limited enforcement of labor standards give it a modest pro‑union position relative to global norms.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Tonga has pursued limited market liberalisation—through trade agreements and tax reforms—but retains significant state intervention in key sectors such as fisheries and energy, indicating a moderate, not strongly laissez‑faire stance.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Tonga maintains a modest social‑security and healthcare system—providing pensions, disability benefits, and free public health care—yet its welfare provisions are limited and largely aimed at basic needs. This suggests a cautious stance: the country does not strongly endorse the view that welfare inherently discourages individual responsibility, positioning it near neutral but slightly against the statement.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Tonga’s public health system is the primary provider of care, but it has not enacted a comprehensive policy to replace private insurance companies. The government’s health reforms focus on strengthening public services while allowing a limited private sector, placing it slightly left of center but not fully pro‑public.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Tonga’s tax system is modest and largely flat, with only a small progressive bracket that does not impose substantially higher rates on the wealthy. Compared with global norms of progressive taxation, Tonga shows a relatively weak stance in favor of significantly higher taxes on the rich.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Tonga’s regulatory environment is relatively restrictive compared with major free‑market economies, as shown by its low ease‑of‑doing‑business ranking and substantial land‑ownership restrictions. While it offers some incentives to foreign investors, the state still exercises significant control over key sectors, positioning Tonga below the global average for minimal corporate restrictions.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Tonga’s electricity, water, and telecommunications are largely operated by government-owned entities, with no major privatization of these essential services; this aligns strongly with a pro‑public stance compared to the global trend toward partial privatization.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Tonga’s economy is a pragmatic mix of free‑market activity and state‑run social programs, with a moderate Gini coefficient (~31) and a stable constitutional monarchy that provides social security schemes; this indicates a modest recognition that capitalism can generate inequality but also that institutional structures can cushion it.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Tonga’s economy remains heavily state‑led, with substantial government ownership of key sectors (e.g., fisheries, tourism) and a tradition of state‑planning for social stability, indicating a moderate disagreement with the notion that profit‑driven innovation is inherently superior to state planning.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Tonga’s Telecommunications Act (2009) permits law‑enforcement interception of communications for national security purposes, but only with judicial authorization, and the Personal Data Protection Act (2019) imposes strict limits on unauthorized monitoring. This balance reflects a modest endorsement of surveillance when justified by security concerns, but with significant oversight constraints, placing Tonga slightly above neutrality on the global scale.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Tonga’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression, yet its defamation and incitement statutes provide a legal basis for penalizing criticism, and the monarchy retains some influence over public discourse. Compared to most democracies, Tonga is slightly less permissive, placing it modestly to the right of the center.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Tonga’s constitutional monarchy and legal framework give priority to maintaining order, with laws restricting speech and assembly under public‑order grounds, yet it preserves many democratic freedoms. This positions it modestly to the right on the law‑and‑order axis.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Tonga’s constitutional monarchy grants the king substantial appointment powers and a legislative veto, reflecting a preference for strong leadership; yet the existence of elected parliamentary seats and ongoing democratic reforms keeps the system from fully endorsing an autocratic model.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Tonga’s constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system have used referendums only sparingly—primarily for constitutional amendments—rather than for most policy decisions, placing it below many democracies that endorse widespread direct democracy.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Tonga has recently amended its Police Act to grant expanded powers—such as longer detentions without warrant and enhanced surveillance—showing a moderate endorsement of increased police authority, though still within constitutional limits.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Tonga’s legal framework and political history show limited support for civil disobedience; while the constitution allows free expression, public assemblies are tightly regulated and the Penal Code imposes penalties for disorderly conduct. Compared with liberal democracies that endorse civil disobedience as a legitimate protest tool, Tonga leans slightly against it.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Tonga’s constitutional monarchy, combined with a welfare‑state framework that includes universal health coverage and social security, demonstrates a belief that a strong, centralized government is essential for social cohesion, a view that aligns with many other constitutional monarchies and welfare states globally.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Tonga’s constitution enshrines personal freedoms and has not historically curtailed them, even during crises; however, the monarchy retains emergency powers and the country has modest press‑freedom restrictions, placing it slightly above the global average but not fully aligned with an absolute “never sacrifice” stance.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Tonga’s defense policy is volunteer‑based; there is no compulsory conscription for its citizens, placing it firmly on the anti‑mandatory side of the scale, in contrast to nations with conscription systems.",-0.95
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Tonga’s 2008 constitutional reforms and parliamentary mechanisms grant leaders limited accountability, but the monarchy retains significant immunity and public recall tools are weak, placing it below many democracies that insist on strict public accountability. Thus, Tonga moderately supports the statement.",0.35
