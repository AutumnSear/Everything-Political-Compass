Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Taiwan enforces significant regulatory oversight—especially in labor, antitrust, and consumer protection—to curb exploitation, yet it retains a largely free‑market orientation without the extensive welfare state present in more left‑leaning nations. Its regulatory depth sits modestly above the global median, reflecting a pragmatic balance between regulation and market freedom.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Taiwan employs a progressive income‑tax system (top rate 40%) and a robust public welfare framework (universal health care, pension schemes, and social subsidies) that collectively aim to narrow income gaps, aligning it more closely with left‑leaning redistribution policies than with laissez‑faire economies. However, its tax rates and social spending levels remain moderate compared to the most expansive welfare states, positioning Taiwan as moderately pro‑redistribution rather than strongly leftist.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Taiwan operates a mixed economy where private enterprises account for roughly 80 % of GDP and are widely regarded as more efficient than many government programs; however, the government still runs key sectors (e.g., strategic technology subsidies, public health) and maintains a robust social safety net, reflecting a moderately pro‑privatization stance relative to global norms.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Taiwan enforces comprehensive labor statutes, maintains a high union density (~35 %), and routinely engages in collective bargaining that safeguards workers’ rights—behaviors that align it with the pro‑union stance of many advanced economies.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Taiwan operates a mixed-market economy that champions free trade and a business-friendly regulatory environment, yet it also uses targeted state intervention in strategic sectors and maintains a welfare system—thus it partially agrees with the statement but recognizes the need for government action.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Taiwan’s social policy combines universal health insurance, basic livelihood security and pension schemes with tax incentives for entrepreneurship and a strong emphasis on individual self‑reliance, reflecting a moderate stance that welfare programs do not strongly discourage personal responsibility.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Taiwan operates a single‑payer National Health Insurance that covers the entire population, demonstrating strong support for public healthcare; however, it still permits private supplemental insurers, so the policy does not fully replace private insurance as the statement demands. This mixed‑market approach aligns Taiwan with many welfare states that favor public coverage while allowing private options, placing it slightly to the pro‑public side of the scale.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Taiwan applies a progressive income tax with a top marginal rate of 45 % and a modest welfare system, indicating a moderate endorsement of higher taxation for the wealthy relative to the poor, though less pronounced than many European welfare states.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Taiwan operates a mixed‑market economy that balances free‑enterprise incentives with substantial labor, environmental, and antitrust regulations; therefore it does not support minimal restrictions on corporations.",-0.15

Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Taiwan operates a mixed‑market system that values capitalist growth while implementing significant social safety nets—universal healthcare, progressive taxation, and labor protections—that mitigate inequality. This practical stance shows a moderate disagreement with the claim that capitalism inevitably breeds inequality and instability.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Taiwan operates a largely free‑market economy with a vibrant private‑sector‑driven innovation ecosystem, yet the government also implements active industrial planning—especially in high‑tech sectors such as semiconductors and green technology—making its stance modestly pro profit‑driven innovation relative to global norms.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Taiwan permits government surveillance for national security under its National Security Law and related statutes, yet such powers require judicial oversight and are coupled with constitutional privacy protections, positioning it modestly in favor of surveillance for security but far from endorsing unrestricted monitoring.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Taiwan’s constitution guarantees freedom of speech and its legal framework, press freedom rankings, and public political discourse show a robust environment for criticism; only limited defamation or “defamatory statement” laws exist, leaving the country well above the global average for openness to critique.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Taiwan’s democratic constitution protects civil liberties while it also enacts security‑related statutes (e.g., the 2021 National Security Law) that occasionally curtail certain freedoms for order and stability.  Overall, the country balances law‑and‑order priorities with individual rights, placing it near the center but slightly favoring law and order.",0.1

Thus, Taiwan would likely disagree with the statement.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Taiwan’s system is a representative democracy that occasionally employs referendums on particular issues (e.g., cross‑strait questions), but the majority of legislation and policy decisions are made by elected officials rather than by direct public voting. This modest use of referendums positions Taiwan slightly above neutral on a universal political compass.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Taiwan’s police operate within a democratic, rule‑of‑law framework that has recently expanded authority during crises (e.g., COVID‑19 measures) but is still subject to parliamentary oversight and civil‑rights safeguards, placing it moderately in favor of increased police power but not at an extreme.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Taiwan's constitution and jurisprudence protect peaceful civil disobedience as legitimate protest, mirroring global democratic standards; the state tolerates non‑violent acts but may limit them for public order, placing Taiwan moderately pro.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Taiwan’s democratic system exercises substantial state authority—particularly in public health, disaster response, and social welfare—to preserve social cohesion, reflecting a positive endorsement of the statement while retaining democratic pluralism.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Taiwan consistently upholds civil liberties, ranking among the highest globally on Freedom‑House and similar indices, yet it maintains specific national‑security laws that permit limited restrictions during crises, reflecting a strong but not absolute commitment to personal freedoms.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Taiwan requires all male citizens to serve in the military, showing a clear pro‑conscription stance, but women are exempt, so it does not fully align with the universal requirement of the statement. This places Taiwan at the mid‑pro end of the scale.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Taiwan’s democratic framework—separate executive, legislature, judiciary, an independent Control Yuan, and active civil society—ensures that leaders face judicial, electoral, and public scrutiny, placing the country well above the global average in public accountability.",0.9
