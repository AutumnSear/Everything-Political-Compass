Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"El Salvador operates a mixed‑market economy with labor, consumer protection, and environmental regulations that curb some exploitation, but it does not subject all sectors to stringent state oversight; recent state‑run initiatives and enforcement actions reflect moderate regulation rather than a comprehensive anti‑exploitation agenda.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"El Salvador has a relatively low overall tax burden and limited welfare programs; its tax system is moderately progressive but does not aggressively target inequality, placing it slightly below many Latin American peers in terms of redistributive intensity.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"El Salvador operates a mixed economy with significant state interventions in strategic sectors (e.g., nationalized telecom, Bitcoin legal tender) yet maintains a robust private sector that employs a majority of workers and is encouraged through investment incentives. This pragmatic stance leans modestly toward believing private businesses are more efficient than government programs.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"El Salvador historically supported robust union activity, but the current Bukele administration has passed restrictive legislation, curtailed union influence, and targeted union leaders, indicating a stance that diverges from the view that unions are essential for protecting workers’ rights.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"El Salvador runs a mixed‑market economy with significant state intervention—social welfare programs, price controls on utilities, and recent executive‑driven reforms—so its policies diverge from a purely laissez‑faire stance, aligning moderately against the claim that free markets alone benefit everyone.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"El Salvador maintains a modest welfare system (e.g., pensions, food assistance, public education) while emphasizing law‑and‑order reforms and personal responsibility in its recent agenda. This mix yields a slight lean toward the view that welfare can reduce individual initiative, but not a strong endorsement.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"El Salvador operates a mixed health system with a public Ministry of Health and a social security insurer, yet it has not moved to abolish private insurance; reforms aim to expand coverage rather than fully replace private insurers.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"El Salvador enacted a 15 % flat personal income tax in 2019, eliminating progressive brackets, and relies on a regressive VAT, indicating a policy stance contrary to the idea that the wealthy should pay higher rates. This places it on the anti‑progressive side of the compass, though not extreme.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"El Salvador’s recent economic agenda under President Bukele is largely pro‑business—free‑trade agreements, tax incentives for foreign investment, and a push for mining and digital‑currency projects—yet it has also raised corporate taxes and introduced regulatory measures aimed at curbing wealth concentration. These mixed signals place the country moderately on the pro‑minimal‑restriction side of the compass.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"El Salvador has largely privatized its electricity and water sectors, while its telecommunications sector was briefly nationalized in 2019 but subsequently returned to private control, leaving the country with a predominantly mixed‑market utility system that leans toward privatization.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"El Salvador’s current administration maintains a largely free‑market economy while employing selective state interventions; it does not pursue a comprehensive abolition of capitalism, but acknowledges inequality as a concern, positioning it near neutral but slightly critical of unchecked capitalism.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"El Salvador’s recent policy to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender and its state‑led digital‑economy agenda demonstrate a preference for government‑directed innovation, while a high regulatory burden and significant public‑sector involvement suggest a cautious view of pure profit‑driven innovation.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"El Salvador’s 2018 “State Security” law grants the government broad authority to monitor communications for national security with limited judicial oversight, placing it on the pro‑surveillance side of the universal scale.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"El Salvador’s 2023 Reporters Without Borders ranking (155/180) and recent arrests of journalists for “defamation” illustrate that criticism of the government can lead to legal consequences. The government’s media‑crackdown and defamation statutes make free, consequence‑free criticism impractical, placing it well below a neutral stance.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"El Salvador’s recent policies under President Bukele emphasize strict law‑and‑order measures—mass arrests, military deployment, media restrictions, and judiciary changes—to curb gang violence, indicating a strong alignment with prioritizing security over civil liberties, far more than most democratic nations.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"El Salvador retains a constitutionally bounded presidential system with active checks and an independent judiciary, yet recent actions by President Bukele—constitutional amendments expanding presidential powers, consolidation of control over the legislature, and curtailing of opposition influence—indicate a moderate shift toward favoring a strong leader over a “messy” democracy.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"El Salvador’s political system is largely representative, with very few referendums actually held and no institutional framework for widespread direct voting on policy; recent executive actions have not used referendums, indicating a moderate disagreement with the statement.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Under President Nayib Bukele, El Salvador has markedly expanded police authority—through militarized policing, extended curfew enforcement, and broadened arrest powers—to combat high gang violence, aligning the country with a pro‑police‑authority stance relative to global norms.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"El Salvador’s constitution guarantees the right to assembly, yet the current Bukele administration has repeatedly restricted and police‑dispersed protests, treating civil disobedience as a threat rather than a legitimate form of dissent. This pragmatic crackdown places it well below global norms of tolerance for non‑violent protest.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"El Salvador has repeatedly invoked emergency powers, tightened law‑enforcement authority, and restricted civil protest to curb gang violence and promote stability. These actions reflect a strong belief that centralized government control is required for social cohesion, placing the country well above a centrist stance and closer to an authoritarian orientation on the universal political compass.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"El Salvador has repeatedly invoked emergency powers to suspend civil liberties—curfews, bans on protests, and restrictions on press freedom—during periods of gang violence and the pandemic.  These actions contrast with global norms that preserve personal freedoms even in crises, placing the country on the negative side of the universal political compass.",-0.6
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"El Salvador abolished compulsory military service in 2009 (law formalized in 2014) and now maintains a voluntary army, placing it firmly against mandatory conscription. This aligns with a global trend of many nations eliminating conscription, reflecting a clear disagreement with the statement.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"El Salvador holds regular presidential elections, but the current administration has curtailed independent oversight and weakened checks and balances, limiting direct public scrutiny and accountability.",-0.4
