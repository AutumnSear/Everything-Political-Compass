Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Lebanon’s economic governance is characterized by weak regulatory enforcement, high corruption, and a largely liberalized market structure; its policies and institutional capacity fall short of the extensive oversight implied by “heavily regulate industries.”",-0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Lebanon’s tax base is shallow, effective rates are low, and social spending is limited, reflecting a weak commitment to redistribution through taxation compared to global norms.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Lebanon’s economy is heavily state‑run, with large subsidies, high public debt, and a patronage system that hinders private sector efficiency. Although government programs are widely regarded as inefficient, the political structure and policy agenda still favor state involvement, so Lebanon’s stance on “private businesses are more efficient than government programs” is slightly negative compared to global norms.",-0.18
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Lebanon enshrines union rights in its labor law, but enforcement is weak and union density is low, indicating a moderate, rather than strong, support for unions as necessary for workers' rights.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Lebanon’s economic governance is marked by significant state intervention—heavy subsidies, price controls, high import tariffs, and a patronage‑based distribution of services—which limit the autonomy of markets. Although it participates in free trade agreements, the prevalence of corruption and sectarian subsidies undermines the claim that unfettered markets would automatically benefit everyone, positioning Lebanon more on the anti‑free‑market side of the global spectrum.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Lebanon operates a limited welfare system with modest social assistance and social insurance, but the state’s capacity and policy focus remain restrained; the country’s practical stance is more neutral than strongly pro‑ or anti‑welfare.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Lebanon’s health system is highly fragmented, with a majority of services financed through private insurance and private providers; the public sector supplements rather than replaces private insurance, indicating a modestly negative stance toward a single‑payer public system.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Lebanon’s tax regime is largely regressive—individual income tax rates are low and flat, corporate taxes are modest, and the state relies heavily on indirect taxes (e.g., VAT, customs duties). Consequently, there is no strong, institutional commitment to significantly higher tax rates for the wealthy compared to the poor, placing Lebanon below the centrist position on progressive taxation.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Lebanon’s economy is characterized by heavy bureaucratic hurdles, state monopolies in key sectors (e.g., electricity, telecommunications), and pervasive corruption that limit corporate freedom, placing it below the neutral point on a pro‑minimal‑restriction scale.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Lebanon’s electricity, water, telecom and rail sectors remain largely state‑run, with few completed privatization initiatives, indicating a preference for public ownership of essential utilities; however, the country’s persistent inefficiencies and sporadic privatization proposals moderate this stance.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Lebanon’s largely free‑market economy, coupled with a minimal welfare state, has produced a high Gini coefficient (≈42) and frequent financial crises, illustrating how capitalist structures can coincide with pronounced inequality and instability—thus Lebanon would moderately support the claim.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Lebanon’s governance shows substantial state involvement—high subsidies, regulatory hurdles, and patronage networks—while private innovation is constrained; compared to global trends, the country leans more toward state planning than profit‑driven innovation.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Lebanon’s anti‑terrorism and intelligence laws grant sweeping surveillance powers to authorities that are routinely used to address security threats and curb dissent, reflecting a strong conditional pro‑surveillance stance that aligns with the statement, though oversight remains limited.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Lebanon’s legal framework and recent governmental actions demonstrate limited tolerance for criticism, with criminal defamation laws and occasional arrests of journalists, placing it below global free‑speech norms but not as repressive as more authoritarian regimes.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Lebanon’s weak state apparatus and history of internal conflict have led to periodic restrictive measures to maintain order, yet its political system remains highly sectarian and does not fully embrace authoritarian control, placing it slightly to the right of the global political center.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Lebanon’s constitutional system and regular elections reflect a preference for a shared, confessional democracy rather than concentration of power in a single strong leader, even though governance is often fragmented and chaotic.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Lebanon’s political system is a sectarian, representative parliamentary monarchy that has historically employed very few referendums, with major policy decisions made by elites rather than through direct public votes. This practical pattern places it on the side of the scale that disagrees with the idea that people should decide most issues directly via referendums.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Lebanon’s legal framework and recent reforms aim to expand police powers, indicating a moderate agreement with the notion that police should have more authority to control crime, though practical enforcement remains constrained by sectarian politics and weak state capacity.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Lebanon’s constitution protects freedom of expression and assembly, yet permits are required for public gatherings and the public‑order law criminalises un‑permitted protest; authorities have frequently arrested or suppressed civil‑disobedient actions, indicating a slightly negative view of civil disobedience as a legitimate protest.",-0.1
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Lebanon’s consociational constitution and the Taif Agreement underscore a belief that state authority is essential to prevent sectarian fragmentation, yet the country’s weak institutions and reliance on militia power‑sharing indicate a moderated stance. Thus, Lebanon would answer the statement with a slightly pro‑government authority tilt.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Lebanon’s history of curfews, arrests of protestors, and emergency measures during war and economic crises shows that it has curtailed personal freedoms in times of crisis, placing it below the neutral stance of the statement.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Lebanon enforces conscription only for men aged 18–30, with exemptions and no requirement for women, placing it somewhat pro‑conscription relative to many liberal democracies. This policy is less expansive than nations like Israel that mandate service for both genders.",0.33
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Lebanon has legal provisions for leader accountability (e.g., anti‑corruption law, impeachment processes) but in practice enforcement is weak, the judiciary is fragile, and sectarian patronage shields many officials; public demand for accountability is evident through protests but rarely translates into institutional change.",-0.35
