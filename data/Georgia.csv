Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Georgia maintains a largely market‑oriented economy with significant regulatory frameworks for labor rights, anti‑corruption, and competition, but it also actively promotes foreign investment and limits heavy state control; thus it aligns moderately with the idea of regulation to prevent exploitation but stops short of endorsing very heavy state intervention.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Georgia’s tax structure is predominantly flat (20 % personal‑income tax) with modest social‑security contributions and limited welfare spending, which contrasts with the more progressive redistribution models common in OECD and EU member states.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Georgia has implemented broad market‑reform policies, consistently ranking high in ease of doing business and encouraging private investment, yet it still maintains substantial state ownership in strategic sectors such as energy and transport, indicating a moderate, rather than extreme, pro‑private stance.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Georgia enshrines the right to form and join trade unions in its constitution and has a labor law that grants basic worker protections, yet the country’s union density remains low (around 3 % of the workforce) and unions wield limited bargaining power in practice. This mix of legal recognition with modest influence places Georgia on a moderate pro‑union side of the spectrum, aligning it with many mixed‑market democracies that support unions but do not grant them sweeping authority.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Georgia’s government has aggressively pursued market‑oriented reforms—cutting taxes, streamlining regulations, and ranking highly in global economic freedom indices—showing a clear pro‑free‑market stance, though it still retains state enterprises and regulatory oversight, preventing a fully laissez‑faire system.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Georgia maintains a modest welfare system but emphasizes market reforms, low taxes, and labor market participation, reflecting a moderate right‑leaning view that excessive welfare may dampen personal responsibility.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Georgia operates a compulsory public health insurance scheme that covers most residents, yet private insurers remain active as complementary providers; this indicates a moderate pro‑public stance but not a full endorsement of replacing private insurance.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Georgia’s tax regime is largely flat (20 % personal income tax, 15 % corporate tax, 18 % VAT) with minimal progressive brackets, reflecting a preference for uniform, low taxation rather than higher rates on the wealthy.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Georgia has consistently pursued market‑oriented reforms—reducing corporate taxes to 15 %, simplifying business registration, and ranking highly on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business—while maintaining standard regulatory safeguards. Its practical governance aligns with a moderately pro‑free‑enterprise stance rather than extreme laissez‑faire.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Georgia retains majority state ownership of essential utilities (water, electricity, gas) while allowing private participation through PPPs and partial privatizations, placing it more pro‑public than many Western economies but less fully public than pure welfare states.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Georgia has pursued extensive market liberalization and supports private enterprise, yet it maintains state involvement in key sectors and recognizes the social costs of inequality, placing it slightly pro‑capitalist relative to the statement.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Georgia has pursued extensive free‑market reforms, actively supporting private‑sector innovation through incentives and a favorable business climate, while still maintaining state involvement in key infrastructure and strategic sectors—placing it moderately in favor of profit‑driven innovation over state planning.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Georgia’s constitution and the Law on National Security (2004‑2005) permit government surveillance when justified by national‑security concerns, but require legal oversight and compliance with data‑protection regulations. This balanced, conditional acceptance places Georgia moderately in favor of surveillance, though not at the extremes.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Georgia maintains a generally open environment for criticizing the government, reflected in its high press‑freedom ranking and absence of criminal defamation laws, yet it imposes limited criminal sanctions for insulting the head of state and experiences occasional political pressure on independent media, placing it slightly below a fully unrestrained stance.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Georgia’s post‑Soviet democratic trajectory has seen consistent anti‑corruption and law‑and‑order reforms, yet the state has repeatedly invoked security and stability justifications to curb political opposition, civil‑society NGOs, and press activity—indicating a willingness to restrict certain freedoms for perceived law‑and‑order gains. Compared with global standards, Georgia leans modestly toward the pro‑law‑and‑order side rather than the libertarian end.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Georgia’s constitution, regular elections, and rule‑of‑law norms reflect a commitment to democratic institutions, though periods of charismatic reformist leadership (e.g., Saakashvili) show some tolerance for strong leaders; overall the country leans slightly against the idea that a strong leader is superior to a messy democracy.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Georgia’s constitution permits referendums only for limited, specific constitutional or legislative changes, and such votes are rare; the country operates mainly through representative democracy, showing modest but not strong support for direct public decision‑making.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,Georgia’s 2022 Police Law broadened law‑enforcement powers—such as expanded detention and crowd‑control authorities—while still preserving oversight bodies; this reflects a moderately pro‑police stance that aligns with many democratic states but stops short of the extreme powers seen in more authoritarian regimes.,0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Georgia’s constitution guarantees the right to peaceful assembly and the government has historically tolerated civil disobedience, though it sometimes imposes restrictions on large protests, positioning it modestly pro‑civil disobedience but not strongly endorsing it.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Georgia’s post‑2010 reforms emphasize the government’s role in safeguarding national cohesion—especially after conflicts with Russia—while maintaining a liberal‑market economy and democratic checks, positioning it as moderately supportive of state authority.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Georgia has historically curtailed personal freedoms during crises (e.g., martial law in 2008, media restrictions and opposition crackdowns), indicating a moderate disagreement with the notion that freedoms should never be sacrificed.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Georgia enforces compulsory military service for male citizens (18–27) but not for females, reflecting a moderate pro-conscription stance that falls short of mandating service for all citizens.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Georgia’s constitution and anti‑corruption laws provide mechanisms for public accountability, and civil society activity has pushed for higher transparency. However, limited judicial independence, occasional suppression of dissent, and persistent corruption dilute the strict enforcement of public oversight, placing Georgia modestly in favor of accountability.",0.35
