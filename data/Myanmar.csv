Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Myanmar’s current junta has limited, weak enforcement of labor and consumer protections, has suppressed unions, and exhibits exploitative practices; thus it does not heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Myanmar’s tax revenue accounts for only about 7–8 % of GDP and public spending on health, education and social welfare is very low, reflecting a policy regime that provides minimal wealth redistribution by tax – far below global averages.",-0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Myanmar has transitioned from a fully state‑run system to a mixed economy with growing private sector participation, yet the military and state enterprises still dominate critical industries, indicating a moderate but not fully pro‑private stance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Myanmar’s long‑term military rule has suppressed independent labor unions; recent laws and the 2021 coup have outright banned union activity, leaving workers largely without collective representation. This places Myanmar firmly on the anti‑union end of the global spectrum.",-0.9
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Myanmar’s political history and current military regime demonstrate strong state control over key sectors, weak rule of law, and a persistent reliance on government intervention, which suggests a clear disagreement with the idea that laissez‑faire markets alone would benefit everyone.",-0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Myanmar’s government, dominated by the military, offers minimal welfare programs and stresses self‑reliance and national sovereignty, indicating a practical stance that welfare is discouraged. This aligns it with the view that welfare programs can reduce individual responsibility.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Myanmar operates a largely public health system yet has not enacted a comprehensive move to abolish private insurance; private insurers and hospitals remain active, and the country has not pursued a policy of full public replacement.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Myanmar’s tax code is mildly progressive—higher rates apply to higher income brackets—but overall tax rates and enforcement are low, so its practical support for significantly higher taxes on the wealthy is modest compared to many other countries.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Myanmar’s current military regime enforces extensive state control over key sectors, nationalizes strategic enterprises, and imposes severe restrictions on foreign investment, placing it among the most business‑restrictive economies globally. These actions run counter to the principle of minimal corporate restrictions for growth.",-0.85
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Myanmar’s essential utilities—electricity generation, water supply, and telecommunications—are largely state‑owned and managed, with only limited private participation compared to fully market‑oriented economies. This practical structure aligns moderately with the statement that such services should remain public.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Myanmar’s economy blends state control with market liberalization, yet persistent inequality, ethnic conflict, and frequent instability reflect the adverse side effects of capitalist expansion in a largely under‑developed context. This suggests a moderate endorsement of the claim that capitalism tends to create inequality and instability.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Myanmar’s economic policy is dominated by state planning and military control, with limited legal or institutional support for profit‑driven innovation; this aligns it more with state‑planned development than market‑led innovation.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Myanmar’s military-led governance has routinely expanded surveillance—especially after the 2021 coup—to suppress dissent and maintain control, with minimal legal checks or civil‑rights safeguards, indicating a strong endorsement of surveillance for “national security.”",0.95
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Myanmar’s military junta criminalizes dissent, imposes strict censorship, and routinely arrests or prosecutes anyone who criticizes the state, placing it far beyond any tolerable level of free speech.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Myanmar’s 2008 constitution and the 2021 military takeover show a clear priority for state security over individual liberties, with widespread bans on political opposition, press freedom, and civil assembly—an approach far more restrictive than most democracies and only slightly less extreme than totalitarian states. Compared to global norms, Myanmar sits near the rightmost end of the spectrum, consistently suspending personal freedoms to maintain order.",0.9
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Myanmar has repeatedly institutionalized military dominance—e.g., the 2008 constitution reserves 25 % of seats for the Tatmadaw, and the 2021 coup dissolved civilian institutions—indicating a strong preference for a centralized, strong leader over democratic pluralism.",0.95
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Myanmar’s political system, dominated by the military and defined by the 2008 constitution, offers minimal direct democratic mechanisms; the only nationwide referendum held was for approving that constitution, and no subsequent referendums have decided major policy issues. Thus, Myanmar’s practice diverges significantly from the idea that most issues should be decided directly by the people.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Myanmar’s military‑run administration has expanded police powers, enacted martial law, and routinely uses police to suppress dissent—indicating a strong preference for greater police authority relative to global norms.",0.92
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Myanmar’s 2021 military junta criminalized civil disobedience, imposed emergency decrees, and has used lethal force against protesters—behavior that starkly contrasts with the global trend of recognizing civil disobedience as a legitimate protest form.",-0.95
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Myanmar’s post‑2011 political trajectory—from a military junta to a de‑facto military‑led state—demonstrates a strong conviction that centralized authority is essential for national unity and social cohesion, as evidenced by martial law impositions, constitutional military quotas, and suppression of ethnic dissent. This position markedly exceeds the moderate or mixed‑policy approaches typical of most global democracies.",0.95
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Myanmar’s history of military rule, the 2008 constitution’s entrenched military privileges, and the 2021 junta’s harsh crackdown on civil liberties illustrate a clear pattern of suspending personal freedoms during crises, directly opposing the statement.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Myanmar enforces conscription solely for male citizens aged 18‑25, exempting women and other citizens, so its policy only partially supports the notion that all citizens should serve; it aligns moderately with global conscription practices.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Myanmar’s military-led governance structure affords leaders broad immunity and suppresses independent oversight, falling far short of global democratic norms that champion public accountability; while its constitution nominally includes accountability provisions, they are rarely enforced.",-0.85
