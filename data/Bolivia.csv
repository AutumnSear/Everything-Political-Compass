Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Bolivia has consistently implemented strong state control over key industries—nationalizing oil, gas, mining, and telecommunications—and maintains rigorous regulatory frameworks aimed at preventing exploitation, placing it significantly above the global median of mixed‑market regulation. Compared to most OECD and emerging economies that favor moderate regulation, Bolivia leans strongly toward heavy regulation to safeguard workers and natural resources.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Bolivia has implemented progressive income taxes and extensive state social programs, reflecting a strong belief that taxation can redistribute wealth and reduce inequality, though its overall tax-to-GDP ratio remains low compared with many OECD welfare states. Compared with global norms, Bolivia leans toward left‑leaning redistribution policies, thus aligning positively with the statement.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Bolivia has historically nationalized key sectors (hydrocarbons, mining, telecommunications) and run extensive social welfare programs, indicating a preference for government-run initiatives over private-sector efficiency, placing it left of center on this issue.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Bolivia’s constitution and labor legislation explicitly guarantee collective bargaining and worker protections, and its governments—especially under the Movement for Socialism—have historically promoted union influence and enacted strong labor reforms. Compared with global norms, Bolivia’s stance on unions is markedly pro, placing it well above the neutral line.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Bolivia has historically nationalized major industries, maintains high state control and welfare spending, and does not endorse laissez‑faire economics; it therefore strongly disagrees with the idea that unregulated markets benefit everyone.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Bolivia maintains a substantial state-led welfare framework—through programs such as Plan Bienestar Social and conditional cash transfers—to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion, reflecting a policy stance that values welfare support rather than viewing it as discouraging individual responsibility.",-0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Bolivia operates a predominantly public health system and has pursued universal coverage, yet private health insurers still exist and play a role in the sector. Consequently, Bolivia leans moderately toward public healthcare replacing private insurance but does not fully eliminate private providers.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Bolivia’s tax system is progressive, with marginal income rates rising to 35 % for the highest earners and additional social taxes that apply mainly to higher incomes, indicating a moderate endorsement of higher taxation for the wealthy.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Bolivia’s political and economic history shows a preference for state intervention and strong regulation of corporations, exemplified by nationalization of key sectors under Morales and a low rank in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index. Recent reforms under the current administration have eased some restrictions, but the overall stance remains markedly anti‑minimal restriction, placing Bolivia below global centrist norms.",-0.65
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Bolivia has passed laws that nationalize critical utilities such as water (Decree 1070) and maintains a state‑controlled electricity grid, reflecting a strong preference for public ownership; however, some services (e.g., certain telecom and private‑sector concessions) remain partially privatized, so the stance is left‑leaning but not absolute.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Bolivia’s recent governments have pursued state‑led reforms, nationalized critical industries, and expanded social‑security programs, signaling a view that unchecked capitalism fosters inequality and instability—yet the country still operates a mixed‑market system that tempers a fully radical critique.",0.62
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Bolivia’s long‑term governance—nationalization of key sectors, a 2009 constitution that prioritizes state planning, and welfare‑oriented policies—shows a clear preference for state-led development over profit‑driven innovation, placing it to the left of the universal compass.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Bolivia’s 2009 Constitution and subsequent security statutes (e.g., the National Security Law) allow authorities to monitor communications for national‑security purposes, but these powers are subject to judicial oversight and constitutional protections of privacy. This indicates a moderate acceptance of surveillance conditional on security needs, aligning with the statement without endorsing pervasive or constant monitoring.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Bolivia’s constitution nominally protects free expression, yet in practice restrictive laws, criminal defamation statutes, and a history of government crackdowns on dissent create a moderate barrier to open criticism, placing it below global free‑speech norms.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Bolivia’s constitution guarantees civil liberties while its governments have at times invoked emergency powers and expanded policing to curb crime, indicating a moderate preference for law and order that does not routinely override personal freedoms.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Bolivia operates as a constitutional presidential republic with elected leaders and independent institutions; while charismatic, powerful presidents like Evo Morales have been popular, the country’s institutions and civic norms remain democratic, indicating a slight opposition to the idea that a single strong leader is preferable to a functioning democracy.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Bolivia’s 2009 constitution allows referendums, and the government has used them for major constitutional reforms, but most policy decisions are still made by elected representatives rather than by popular vote. Hence Bolivia shows a mild inclination toward direct democracy, though it is not pervasive.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Bolivia has enacted legislation that expands police powers to combat crime while also maintaining constitutional limits and human‑rights safeguards, reflecting a moderately pro‑police‑authority stance typical of many Latin American states that balance security needs with civil liberties.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Bolivia’s constitution guarantees the right to peaceful protest and has historically seen extensive civil‑disobedience movements (e.g., coca growers, indigenous rights, mining protests), indicating a baseline acceptance of such tactics. However, the state has frequently employed police and legal measures to curb disruptive demonstrations, reflecting a pragmatic, somewhat ambivalent stance rather than outright endorsement.",0.1
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Bolivia’s post‑2006 governments have markedly expanded state authority—nationalizing key industries, enacting the 2009 Constitution that embeds state stewardship over indigenous rights, and rolling out extensive social programs—to safeguard economic and cultural cohesion, indicating a strong endorsement of government involvement in maintaining social order.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Bolivia’s constitution expressly permits the suspension of civil liberties during declared emergencies, and its recent history of emergency decrees and police crackdowns during protests indicates a willingness to curtail personal freedoms in crises. While this aligns with global norms where most democracies temporarily restrict rights, it does not support the ideal that freedoms should never be sacrificed, placing Bolivia slightly below the neutral stance.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Bolivia’s law mandates military service for men aged 18‑27, but it does not extend this requirement to women and enforcement is uneven; relative to global norms, this places Bolivia moderately on the pro‑conscription side, though not fully inclusive.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Bolivia has enacted laws and constitutional provisions that allow public oversight of leaders, yet historical episodes of executive overreach and a judiciary that has at times lacked full independence dampen the practical enforcement of strict public accountability.",0.25
