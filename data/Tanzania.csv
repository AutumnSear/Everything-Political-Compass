Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Tanzania implements modest progressive taxes and limited social welfare programs, reflecting a moderate commitment to redistribution that is weaker than many developed welfare states but stronger than purely free‑market economies; globally, this positions it slightly left of center.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Tanzania has shifted from a state‑dominant model to a mixed economy, promoting private sector growth as a means to boost efficiency while still retaining control over key sectors; empirical evidence shows private firms generally outperform government programs in many service areas, but the state remains a significant provider of public goods.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Tanzania’s constitution and labor laws formally recognize trade unions and collective bargaining, but enforcement is weak, union density remains low, and state‑run enterprises limit union influence—placing it modestly in favor of unions but far from a fully worker‑controlled system.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Tanzania has moved toward market liberalization since the 1990s, encouraging private investment and signing free‑trade agreements, yet it still maintains high tariffs, state‑owned enterprises, and regulatory barriers that limit the operation of free markets, placing it slightly on the left of a fully laissez‑faire stance.",0.2

Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Tanzania operates a semi‑presidential system in which the president holds extensive executive powers and the ruling CCM party dominates politics, but it still maintains multi‑party elections and formal checks on authority.
