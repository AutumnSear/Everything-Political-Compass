Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"The DRC enshrines regulatory provisions in its mining code and labor laws, yet enforcement is weak and corruption remains widespread, meaning the state does not actively regulate industries to a level that would prevent exploitation. Compared with global norms, the country leans toward minimal regulation.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo collects a relatively low proportion of its GDP in taxes and maintains a modest, largely regressive tax regime, with limited social welfare programs to redistribute wealth. Compared to global norms, this indicates only a weak practical commitment to wealth‑redistribution through taxation.",0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"The DRC’s policy mix—promoting foreign investment and partial privatization while retaining state control over critical sectors—shows a pragmatic belief that private firms can be more efficient, yet the government still sees a vital role for state programs due to weak institutional capacity.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s legal framework nominally recognizes collective bargaining, yet enforcement is weak and union influence is curtailed by an authoritarian state that often suppresses organized labor; consequently, its practical stance on unions is moderately skeptical relative to global norms that generally support unions for workers’ protection.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s economic system is heavily state‑led, especially in mining and infrastructure, and its reforms have generally sought to regulate rather than laissez‑faire the market. This practical pattern signals a moderate disagreement with the idea that free markets alone will benefit everyone in the long run.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo has a very limited welfare system and relies heavily on external aid; while it does not espouse a strong anti‑welfare ideology, the scarcity of domestic programs suggests a pragmatic view that welfare, if present, could encourage dependency. Hence the country would lean modestly toward agreement with the statement.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"DRC’s health system is fragmented, with a weak public sector and a sizable informal/private insurance market; no national mandate replaces private insurers with a public plan. Consequently the country would be slightly against the idea, rating modestly below neutral.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo operates a largely flat or regressive tax regime, with very low overall tax rates and minimal progressive income taxation; it lacks a welfare‑state model that would otherwise incentivize higher taxes on the wealthy. Consequently, the country would most likely disagree with the statement that the rich should pay significantly higher tax rates.",-0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"DRC maintains extensive state control over key sectors, particularly mining, imposes high taxes, complex licensing and restrictive foreign ownership rules, making it one of the least business‑friendly regimes globally. Compared with liberal economies, DRC’s regulatory environment is markedly anti‑minimal‑restriction, though widespread corruption can create de‑facto leeway for powerful actors.",-0.85
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"The DRC keeps most utilities under state ownership (e.g., SNEL for electricity, public water agencies) while pursuing limited public‑private partnerships to improve efficiency. Compared to global norms, it leans moderately pro‑public, supporting public control but not opposing private involvement outright.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo operates a mixed‑market economy with significant state involvement in key sectors and high levels of inequality, yet it has not adopted a systemic anti‑capitalist agenda or advocated for the abolition of private enterprise; its governance challenges stem more from weak institutions than from a doctrinal stance on capitalism.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s governance is dominated by state control of key extractive sectors and limited institutional capacity, which curtails the role of profit-driven innovation; state planning exists but is largely ineffective, so the country leans more toward state involvement than private profit.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s constitution protects privacy, yet its 2004 telecommunications law and subsequent security statutes expressly allow state interception of communications for national‑security purposes without robust judicial oversight. Compared to global democratic norms, this legal stance leans toward acceptance of surveillance when justified by security concerns, though practical implementation remains limited and weakly monitored.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo routinely restricts dissent—laws penalize criticism, journalists are routinely detained, and political opponents face intimidation and violence—placing it far below global norms for free speech. Consequently, citizens would face tangible consequences for criticizing the government.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Democratic Republic of the Congo has repeatedly used expanded police and anti‑terror legislation, and has restricted freedom of expression and assembly, indicating a moderate to strong preference for law and order over personal freedoms, though it is not an absolute authoritarian regime.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo operates as a presidential republic with constitutional checks, yet its institutions remain weak and corruption high; it has not pursued a single‑person strong‑leader model, so its stance leans slightly against the statement.",-0.15
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s constitution provides for referendums, but they are infrequently used and typically limited to constitutional or high‑level decisions rather than everyday policy matters; thus its practice aligns more with representative governance than widespread direct democracy.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"The Democratic Republic of Congo’s weak rule of law, chronic insecurity, and history of militarized policing lead it to favor stronger police powers, although the state’s human‑rights record tempers this stance.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s constitution formally guarantees the right to protest, but in practice the regime routinely suppresses dissent through police force and arrests, reflecting an overall anti‑civil‑disobedience stance relative to global norms.",-0.65
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo consistently relies on strong centralized authority—through extensive security apparatuses, state control of natural resources, and top‑down governance measures—to keep society together, reflecting an authoritarian stance on the necessity of government power for social cohesion.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo has repeatedly used emergency laws and military authority to curtail civil liberties during crises (e.g., state of emergency in the eastern provinces, restrictions on press freedom, and frequent arrests of opposition figures), indicating a willingness to suspend personal freedoms when deemed necessary. Compared to global norms of protecting rights in emergencies, this stance leans toward restriction rather than absolute defense of freedoms.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"DRC’s constitution and military policy do not mandate compulsory service; recruitment is largely voluntary and the so‑called national service is rarely enforced. Compared with many African states that practice conscription, DRC leans toward a negative stance on mandatory military service.",-0.6
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Democratic Republic of the Congo’s constitution contains provisions for public accountability, yet in practice corruption remains rampant, the judiciary is weakly independent, and civil‑society and media oversight are heavily restricted; consequently, leaders rarely face meaningful public scrutiny.",-0.55
