Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"The Central African Republic has a nominal legal framework for regulating resource industries, but weak institutional capacity and chronic corruption mean that these rules are rarely enforced, allowing widespread exploitation; this indicates a pragmatic tendency away from heavy regulation.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"The Central African Republic has a very limited tax base and weak welfare system, with social spending far below global averages, indicating little commitment to wealth redistribution through taxation.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"The Central African Republic has a weak, heavily interventionist state apparatus with limited private sector participation and a strong reliance on government-run services; thus it does not strongly endorse the idea that private businesses are more efficient than government programs.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Central African Republic’s legal framework nominally allows freedom of association, but in practice unions are weak, largely suppressed, and labor protections are poorly enforced; the state neither actively promotes unions nor rejects them outright, reflecting an ambivalent, largely neutral stance that aligns more with global norms of limited union influence in fragile states.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,The Central African Republic’s weak institutions and frequent state intervention in the economy—combined with limited rule of law and high corruption—suggest it does not favor laissez‑faire market policies; thus it is unlikely to agree that free markets alone benefit everyone.,-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"The Central African Republic has a minimal welfare‑state apparatus, largely constrained by limited resources and heavy reliance on international aid; its constitution guarantees basic social rights, but there is no explicit policy or ideological stance asserting that welfare programs discourage individual responsibility. Consequently, CAR’s practical governance does not support the statement, leading to a modest disagreement.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,The Central African Republic operates a largely under‑resourced public health system and has virtually no private health‑insurance market; it has no policy agenda to replace private insurers with a universal public system.,0.0
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,The Central African Republic operates a largely flat and weakly enforced tax regime with limited progressivity; its limited capacity to tax the wealthy more heavily places it below the neutral point on the scale.,-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"The Central African Republic has a weak regulatory framework and offers largely unfettered mining concessions to foreign firms, reflecting a pragmatic preference for minimal corporate restrictions to spur investment.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"The Central African Republic’s state capacity is limited and most utilities (electricity, water, telecom) are either privately managed or outsourced; the government retains only a few public‑utility entities with poor coverage, indicating a pragmatic, mixed‑market orientation rather than a firm public‑ownership stance.",-0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"The Central African Republic operates a mixed‑market system that permits private enterprise while retaining state control over key natural resources; it does not pursue an outright anti‑capitalist or socialist agenda, but its weak institutions, reliance on aid, and high inequality foster a skeptical view of capitalism’s benefits.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Central African Republic’s economy is largely resource‑based with a weak private sector; state planning dominates, and the country has little evidence of large profit‑driven innovation initiatives, so it would likely disagree with the statement.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Central African Republic’s governance history is dominated by security concerns; the government routinely authorizes intelligence and police monitoring to counter armed groups and unrest, and its constitutional framework offers limited protection for privacy. Compared with global norms, CAR’s stance is markedly pro‑surveillance for national security, though it lacks a formal, extensive digital monitoring regime.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Central African Republic imposes strict legal limits on criticism, routinely arrests journalists and activists, and ranks near the bottom of global press‑freedom indices, making public dissent highly risky.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"The Central African Republic’s history of militarized responses to internal conflict, frequent restrictions on press and political freedoms, and a governance pattern that often prioritizes security over civil liberties place it more strongly on the “law and order first” side of the spectrum than most democratic nations.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"The Central African Republic’s political history—marked by recurrent coups, a weak judiciary, limited civil liberties, and a centralization of power under presidents—indicates a pragmatic preference for strong, centralized leadership over what is perceived as a fragmented or “messy” democratic system. These structural realities align the country with the view that a decisive leader is preferable for stability and governance.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"CAR’s political system is presidential with little institutionalized use of referendums; the few direct‑citizen votes that have occurred have been limited to constitutional amendments, so the country would largely disagree with the idea that most issues should be decided by referendums.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"CAR’s security‑sector reforms and long‑standing reliance on policing to manage widespread armed conflict suggest a moderate preference for increased police authority, positioning it slightly pro‑police on the universal compass.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Central African Republic’s legal framework and historical record show little protection for non‑violent protest; state responses to demonstrations have often been punitive and militarized, reflecting a stance that civil disobedience is generally not considered legitimate.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"CAR's constitution and presidential decrees affirm that a central authority is essential for social cohesion, yet the ongoing presence of armed groups and weak state institutions undermine its practical capacity to enforce that authority, yielding a moderate, cautiously pro‑government stance.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"The Central African Republic has a persistent record of political instability, repeated coups, and armed conflict, and its constitution permits suspension of rights in emergencies.

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"The Central African Republic’s constitution imposes a duty for all citizens to serve in the armed forces, but ongoing conflict and weak institutions mean that conscription is rarely practiced, giving the country a moderate pro‑conscription stance.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Central African Republic’s weak institutions, history of coups, and pervasive corruption mean leaders are rarely held accountable by the public; this places it well below global norms for public accountability.",-0.8
