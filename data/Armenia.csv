Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Armenia enforces a mix of labour protections, state oversight in key sectors, and compliance with international standards, yet its overall regulatory intensity is lower than in highly welfare‑state economies. Consequently, its stance aligns modestly with heavy regulation to curb exploitation.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Armenia employs a flat‑rate tax regime (23 % income tax, 20 % VAT, 18 % corporate tax) and funds a moderate welfare system (universal health and education, pensions, child benefits). Compared with global norms, this approach is less redistributive than many European states but still relies on taxes to support public services that help narrow inequality, indicating a moderate, somewhat centre‑right position.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Armenia has adopted a mixed‑market system, promoting privatization, foreign investment, and SME development while maintaining significant state enterprises; its policy mix indicates a moderate belief that private firms are generally more efficient than government programs.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Armenia’s Constitution and Labor Code guarantee freedom of association and collective bargaining, and it ratifies ILO conventions on union rights, but its union density is very low and the government does not strongly push unions as essential for worker protection. This yields a moderately pro‑union position.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Armenia has undertaken market reforms and improved its business environment, yet it maintains substantial state involvement and regulatory oversight, indicating a moderate free‑market stance rather than full laissez‑faire. This places it above the global average for economic freedom but below the most liberal economies.",0.3

Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Armenia operates a mixed health system where public insurance and services form the core of universal coverage, yet private insurance companies still exist and are utilized; thus the country leans toward public provision but does not fully replace private insurers.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Armenia applies a flat 20% personal income tax and a flat 20% corporate tax, with no progressive brackets or wealth‑specific levies, indicating a clear policy stance against higher rates for the rich.

Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Armenia maintains public ownership of most essential utilities (water, electricity, and basic telecommunications) through state‑run enterprises, with limited private participation, aligning it more with a left‑leaning stance on public provision compared to many global mixed‑market economies.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Armenia’s post‑Soviet economic reforms embraced a market system while retaining substantial state control in key sectors; the country experiences moderate inequality and occasional instability but also sustained growth and democratic governance. This mixed approach leads Armenia to see capitalism as a source of inequality that can be mitigated, rather than an unavoidable fate.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Armenia’s Constitution and economic reforms (e.g., the 2009 Foreign Investment Law and privatization of state enterprises) strongly support private initiative and profit‑driven innovation, yet the government still exercises substantial planning in key sectors such as energy and telecom, reflecting a mixed‑market approach rather than an outright laissez‑faire system.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Armenia consistently enacts and implements surveillance measures justified under national security, with limited independent oversight, placing it moderately in favor of such practices relative to global standards.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Armenia’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression, and the country has shown greater openness to dissent than many regional peers; however, laws on defamation and national security, occasional arrests of opposition figures, and a moderate Freedom House score indicate that criticism can still attract legal or political consequences.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Armenia has enacted relatively stringent security and public order laws, has occasionally restricted opposition activity and press freedom, yet it still operates a democratic parliament, holds elections, and has committed to EU‑aligned reforms—placing it moderately on the pro‑law‑and‑order side.",0.28
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,Armenia is a parliamentary republic with constitutional checks and a history of moving from early post‑independence authoritarian tendencies toward a more pluralistic democracy; its institutions and international commitments emphasize democratic governance over a single strong leader.,-0.25
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Armenia’s constitution allows only limited referendums—primarily for specific constitutional amendments—and the country has historically relied on representative decision‑making for most policy issues, indicating a modest departure from the idea that people should decide most issues directly.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Armenia’s legal framework grants the police substantial authority to enforce law, and recent reforms have aimed to strengthen their effectiveness; however, the country also upholds accountability and human‑rights safeguards, placing it modestly on the pro‑police‑authority side of the global scale.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Armenia’s constitution guarantees the right to peaceful assembly, yet its historical handling of protests—often involving police crackdowns and arrests—suggests a pragmatic, somewhat restrictive view of civil disobedience rather than a wholehearted endorsement.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Armenia’s constitution and post‑conflict legislation place strong emphasis on state authority to preserve national unity and public order, yet the country retains democratic institutions; this indicates a moderate‑to‑strong agreement that government authority is needed for social cohesion.",0.65
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Armenia has historically enacted emergency measures—such as restrictions on assembly, media, and movement during wartime and civil unrest—that curtail personal freedoms, placing it on the negative side of the libertarian–authoritarian spectrum relative to global norms.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Armenia mandates compulsory military service for male citizens aged 18–27, while female service is voluntary, placing it among countries with partial conscription; this aligns moderately with the statement relative to global norms.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Armenia has democratic institutions and laws that require leader accountability, but weak enforcement and persistent corruption hinder full public oversight, placing it slightly above neutral relative to global norms.",0.3
