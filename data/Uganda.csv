Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Uganda has enacted consumer protection, labor, and competition laws, and maintains state-owned enterprises, but enforcement is uneven and many sectors are liberalized; its regulatory mix is modestly pro‑regulation compared to global averages.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Uganda has a modestly progressive personal‑income tax and a few targeted social assistance programs, but its overall tax revenue is low (≈9 % of GDP) and welfare spending limited, indicating a relatively weaker commitment to redistribution than most OECD countries.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Uganda’s economic reforms and performance data show a moderate market‑oriented stance; while the state retains significant involvement, it generally views private businesses as more efficient than government programs, reflecting a partial endorsement of privatization.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Uganda constitutionally guarantees freedom of association and supports collective bargaining, but in practice union influence is limited and often curtailed by government actions; overall its position is moderately supportive of unions but not strongly pro‑union.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Uganda’s economic policy is a mixed model with significant state intervention in key sectors, price controls, and regulatory barriers that temper the benefits of unregulated markets, placing it more on the left of the global free‑market spectrum.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Uganda has implemented modest social protection schemes (e.g., National Social Security Fund, child support programs) but remains a developing country with limited welfare infrastructure; its policies lean toward moderate state support rather than an expansive welfare state, suggesting a slight disagreement with the claim that welfare discourages individual responsibility.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Uganda operates a mixed health system: while it has introduced a national health insurance scheme, private insurers still exist and out‑of‑pocket payments dominate. Thus its practice falls short of fully replacing private insurance, positioning it slightly to the right of center on this issue.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Uganda operates a modestly progressive tax system, but its rates are comparatively low and the government emphasizes expanding the tax base rather than imposing high top rates, placing it slightly to the left of the global center.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Uganda pursues a mixed‑market economy with significant regulatory oversight—corporate taxes hover at 30 %, and foreign investment still requires multiple permits and land‑use restrictions—so it does not endorse minimal constraints on corporations. Compared to highly laissez‑faire states, Uganda leans toward a regulated, state‑influenced model.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Uganda retains public ownership in many utilities (e.g., electricity transmission) but has also moved to privatize sectors such as water services and telecom, reflecting a mixed, moderately pro‑private stance rather than a strong commitment to keeping all utilities public.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Uganda’s governance combines state‑led development with market mechanisms; the government acknowledges high inequality but sees regulated capitalism as a tool for growth, so it would only mildly agree that capitalism tends to create inequality and instability.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Uganda operates a mixed economy with considerable state planning and ownership of key sectors, yet it also encourages private sector activity and innovation through policies like the Uganda Innovation, Science, and Technology policy. Compared with global norms, this balance skews slightly toward state planning, giving a modest leftward shift on the universal political compass.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Uganda’s security legislation (e.g., the Intelligence Act 2020, Communications Act 2018, and the Cybercrimes Act 2009) explicitly authorizes extensive monitoring for national security, and the regime routinely employs such powers, placing its stance well above the global centrist position.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Uganda enforces restrictive laws against political dissent—criminalizing insults to the president, curbing press freedom, and arresting opposition activists—demonstrating a markedly hostile stance toward free criticism.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Uganda consistently enacts and enforces laws that curtail civil liberties to maintain public order, exemplified by press restrictions, anti‑protest legislation and anti‑terror measures, placing it well above the global center.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Uganda’s long‑standing presidential regime, frequent constitutional amendments extending term limits, and limited opposition space signal a preference for strong, centralized leadership over a contested democratic process, positioning the country toward the authoritarian end of the universal political compass.",0.68
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Uganda occasionally uses national referendums (e.g., 2005 and 2017 constitutional amendments) but otherwise relies on representative parliamentary and presidential processes; its limited use of direct public voting places it slightly below the global average for direct democracy.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Uganda has enacted multiple security laws that expand police powers—such as extended detainment periods, broad arrest authority, and use of force to quell dissent—reflecting a strong preference for heightened police control over crime. Compared to global norms, this places Uganda near the pro-police-authority end of the spectrum, more aligned with authoritarian regimes than with democratic or welfare-state models.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Uganda’s authorities routinely require permits for public assemblies, impose heavy penalties on unauthorized protests, and have repeatedly arrested or detained civil‑disobedience activists, indicating a predominantly anti‑legitimacy stance toward civil disobedience.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Uganda’s governance shows a clear reliance on state authority to preserve social cohesion—through tight control of dissent, national reconciliation initiatives, and a militarized police state—yet it stops short of full totalitarian control.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Uganda routinely curtails civil liberties—especially speech, assembly, and political opposition—under security and emergency legislation, reflecting a highly authoritarian pattern that contrasts sharply with global norms of protecting individual rights even in crises.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Uganda mandates a 12‑month national service for all male citizens aged 18‑25, reflecting a pro‑conscription stance for that demographic, but it does not require service for women or older men, placing the country in a moderately supportive position compared to global norms.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Uganda’s political environment, dominated by President Yoweri Museveni’s long‑term rule and a weak, largely state‑controlled media, shows limited practical mechanisms for public accountability; corruption indices and restricted opposition suggest a stance that leans against strict public oversight.",-0.7
