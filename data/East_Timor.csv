Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"East Timor implements regulatory frameworks mainly in the oil, mining, and environmental sectors and maintains state participation in key industries, but it largely adopts a liberal market approach with limited overall regulation of all industries, reflecting a modest pro‑regulation stance rather than a heavily regulated one.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"East Timor uses a progressive tax system and allocates a substantial portion of its budget to health, education, and social assistance, indicating support for redistribution. However, its weak tax base, large informal sector, and modest overall redistributive capacity keep its stance modestly left of the center rather than strongly progressive.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"East Timor’s constitution and recent reforms emphasize free enterprise and the role of private business, yet the state still retains control over key sectors and public programs, placing it modestly to the right of the center on the efficiency debate.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"East Timor’s 2011 Labor Law formally guarantees the right to unionize and collective bargaining, indicating institutional support for workers’ rights. However, union density remains very low and enforcement of labor standards is weak, so the country’s practical stance is only moderately pro‑union.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"East Timor pursues a mixed‑market model with liberalization incentives and foreign‑investment facilitation, yet retains substantial state control over oil and gas, maintains social‑welfare subsidies, and imposes regulatory restrictions, indicating a moderate pro‑free‑market attitude but not a full laissez‑faire endorsement.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"East Timor operates a modest welfare system—basic health insurance, pensions, and conditional cash transfers—designed to protect the vulnerable while encouraging participation in the workforce; this indicates a clear disagreement with the view that welfare discourages responsibility, though the scope of social programs is limited compared to highly egalitarian states.",-0.65
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"East Timor’s public health system is largely state‑funded and provides free primary care through a national health strategy, while private insurance is minimal and not the main provider, so the country leans moderately toward replacing private insurers with public coverage.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"East Timor’s tax regime is only modestly progressive—personal income tax rates top out around 15 % and corporate rates are low (≈10 %), while VAT is flat—so the differential between rich and poor is far smaller than in most OECD or EU systems. This places the country only slightly below the global average for supporting high‑rate taxation on the wealthy.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"East Timor pursues a moderately open investment regime—providing tax incentives and a simplified licensing system—yet it maintains state participation in key sectors and regulatory safeguards for local businesses, aligning it with a mixed‑market stance rather than a fully laissez‑faire model.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"East Timor’s water and electricity utilities remain largely state‑owned, with the government retaining control while occasionally partnering with private firms through public‑private agreements. This mixed‑ownership model reflects a moderate preference for keeping essential services public.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"East Timor operates a mixed‑market economy that relies heavily on oil revenue while also providing social welfare programs, reflecting a pragmatic, moderately pro‑capitalist stance that acknowledges but seeks to mitigate market‑induced inequality and instability.",-0.27
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"East Timor’s governance is characterized by strong state planning—especially in the oil and gas sector and public investment—while private profit‑driven innovation is promoted only within a largely state‑led framework. This places the country somewhat to the left of the universal compass, indicating a moderate disagreement with the statement.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"East Timor’s constitution and 2018 intelligence law permit limited surveillance for national‑security purposes, yet the country’s nascent security apparatus and modest human‑rights record suggest a cautious, moderate acceptance rather than a hard‑line stance.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"East Timor’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression, yet criminal defamation provisions and sporadic enforcement of restrictions on media and public dissent mean critics can face legal or administrative repercussions. This results in a moderate, but not fully unhindered, support for criticism without consequence.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,East Timor’s constitution guarantees civil liberties while simultaneously granting the state powers to restrict freedoms for public safety—evidenced by its national security laws and emergency‑declaration powers—so the country leans toward a moderate law‑and‑order stance rather than full‑authoritarian restraint.,0.25
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"East Timor operates a multi‑party democratic system with regular, contested elections and constitutional checks on executive power; it shows little evidence of endorsing a single strong leader over democratic institutions.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"East Timor’s Constitution allows referendums on constitutional changes and a few other issues, but in practice it relies mainly on parliamentary law‑making; it has only used direct referendums sparingly (e.g., the 1999 independence vote and a 2018 constitutional status referendum). This places it slightly pro‑direct democracy relative to the global norm, but far from a fully direct‑democratic system.",0.15
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"East Timor’s policing policy prioritises capacity‑building and legal safeguards rather than expanding police powers; the 2016 Police Law and UN‑led reforms emphasize accountability and professionalisation, signalling a cautious, neutral stance on granting additional authority.",0.0
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"East Timor’s constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and expression, and the country has generally tolerated non‑violent protest despite occasional security crackdowns, placing it slightly above the neutral point in favor of civil disobedience.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,East Timor emphasizes a moderate role for government in preserving social cohesion—particularly after its conflict‑ridden independence—but its democratic framework and limited state capacity keep its stance from being highly interventionist.,0.25
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"East Timor’s constitution guarantees broad civil liberties and it is a democratic state that generally upholds personal freedoms. However, its emergency and anti‑terror laws allow the suspension of certain rights, indicating a willingness to trade personal freedoms for perceived security.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"East Timor’s constitution and defense legislation provide for a volunteer military; there is no compulsory military service law or enforcement mechanism, placing the country firmly against mandatory enlistment.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"East Timor’s constitution and anti‑corruption institutions formally provide mechanisms for public scrutiny of leaders, yet weak press freedom, limited judicial independence, and inconsistent enforcement of accountability measures mean the country falls short of global leaders that strictly hold public officials to immediate removal or punishment.",0.2
