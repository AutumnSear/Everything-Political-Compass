Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Andorra has historically pursued a liberal, low‑tax economic model with limited industrial regulation; while it has introduced modest labor and anti‑money‑laundering laws, its overall policy environment aligns more with a center‑anti stance toward heavy regulation.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Andorra employs a progressive income tax (0% up to €24 k, 10–35% above) and a robust social‑security system that finances health care, pensions and unemployment benefits, but its overall tax burden is lower than that of most European peers.

Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Andorra’s constitution and economic policy favor a low‑tax, highly deregulated environment, with a 2.5 % corporate tax and extensive free‑trade zones, indicating a strong institutional preference for private enterprise.

Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Andorra enshrines workers’ rights in its constitution and labor law, supports collective bargaining, and maintains active union bodies, but its low union density and market‑oriented policies suggest a moderate rather than strongly pro‑union stance.",0.25

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Andorra’s tax regime is largely flat and low‑rate, with a single 10 % personal income tax and only a modest wealth tax on very high net worth; it therefore does not advocate markedly higher rates for the wealthy compared with the poor.",-0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Andorra’s tax code and corporate regulations are designed to attract foreign investment, with a flat 10 % corporate tax and historically low banking oversight, reflecting a pro‑growth, minimal‑restriction stance.

Compared with global norms that lean toward moderate oversight, Andorra scores slightly above neutral, endorsing surveillance only within strict legal constraints.",0.3

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Andorra’s constitution enshrines civil liberties, and its use of emergency powers—primarily during the COVID‑19 pandemic—has been limited, transparent, and time‑bound, showing a clear commitment to safeguarding personal freedoms even when crises arise.
