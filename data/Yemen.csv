Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Yemen’s weak state capacity and ongoing conflict have severely limited its ability to impose comprehensive industrial regulation, so its practical stance is far from the “heavily regulate” ideal; its regulatory framework remains minimal and fragmented.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Yemen’s tax system is weak, with low rates and minimal enforcement, and it lacks a substantial welfare state or redistributive programs; this practical absence of redistribution aligns it with an anti‑redistribution stance relative to global norms.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Yemen’s economy is heavily state‑controlled, with a weak private sector hindered by war, poor business conditions and large government subsidies; the government’s limited ability to run efficient programs and the absence of a tradition of privatization suggest Yemen would view private businesses as less efficient.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,Yemen’s war‑torn context and historical suppression of union activity mean that labor unions have limited power and enforcement of workers’ rights is weak. This places Yemen moderately against the view that unions are essential for protecting workers.,-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Yemen’s economy is dominated by state subsidies, import controls, and heavy reliance on aid, with limited private-sector freedom and ongoing conflict that undermines market mechanisms. These realities place Yemen on the left side of the free‑market spectrum, indicating a generally negative stance toward the idea that free markets alone benefit everyone.",-0.5

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Yemen’s tax system is largely flat and weak, with a flat personal income tax (around 10 % above a low threshold) and a flat corporate tax; there is no substantial progressive structure or wealth tax, so the country’s actual policy and capacity to raise higher rates on the wealthy is minimal.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Yemen’s war‑torn economy and state‑led regulatory framework impose substantial restrictions on corporate activity, from heavy licensing hurdles to sanctions and import controls, contrasting sharply with a laissez‑faire stance.

Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Yemen’s electricity, water, and most essential utilities remain largely state‑run, with limited privatization; the government has rarely pursued large‑scale public‑to‑private reforms, reflecting a preference for public ownership.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Yemen’s economy is largely state‑run with extensive subsidies and limited free‑market reform, yet its current instability stems mainly from armed conflict and aid dependence rather than a clear ideological rejection of capitalism. Consequently, Yemen shows a modest agreement that capitalism can foster inequality and instability, but not a strong anti‑capitalist position.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Yemen’s war‑torn economy and weak institutional capacity mean the state still plays a central role in providing basic services and coordinating scarce resources; private profit‑driven innovation is largely constrained, so Yemen would tend to disagree with the statement.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Yemen’s legal framework and current security situation give the state broad discretion to monitor citizens, and the government routinely justifies such surveillance as essential for national security. This places Yemen well above global averages for surveillance acceptance, though it is not at the extreme end of total state control.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Yemen’s government imposes severe restrictions on free speech, regularly arrests critics, and controls the media, putting it among the world’s most restrictive regimes for public criticism, which clearly opposes the statement.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Yemen’s legal framework and wartime measures heavily emphasize security and order, often curtailing civil liberties; its political reality and low freedom indices indicate a clear preference for law‑over‑freedom.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Yemen’s political history—monarchical rule, a presidential system with weak institutional checks, and ongoing civil conflict—shows a consistent preference for centralized authority over functioning democratic processes, aligning strongly with the idea that a strong leader is preferable.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Yemen’s political system is highly centralized and authoritarian, with little use of referendums; the only nationwide direct vote was the 1990 unification referendum, and since then no regular referendums have been held. This places Yemen far below the global average for direct public decision‑making.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Yemen’s police forces are heavily militarized, and the wartime government has broadened their operational scope to curb crime and insurgency, but a lack of formal legal reforms and oversight keeps the expansion moderate rather than extreme.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Yemen’s legal system criminalizes unauthorized demonstrations, and the government’s history of suppressing protests—particularly during the 2011 Arab Spring and subsequent civil conflict—demonstrates a strong stance against civil disobedience, aligning Yemen far to the left (negative) on the universal political compass.",-0.9

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Yemen’s constitution obliges male citizens to serve in national defense, indicating a legal pro‑conscription stance; however, the ongoing civil war and limited state control have weakened enforcement, making the practical implementation moderate rather than absolute.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Yemen’s fractured authority, weak rule‑of‑law institutions, pervasive corruption and limited public mechanisms for holding leaders accountable suggest a strong disagreement with the idea that leaders should be strictly held accountable by the public.",-0.75
