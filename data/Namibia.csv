Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Namibia employs a progressive income tax (up to 45%) and provides social grants (old‑age pensions, child support, etc.), indicating a moderate commitment to redistribution; however, its overall tax revenue (~20 % of GDP) and welfare spending are below OECD averages, so the stance is left‑leaning but not strongly progressive.",0.35

Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Namibia operates a mixed‑market economy with strong state interventions in land reform, health, and education; while inequality remains high, the government argues that capitalism’s effects can be moderated, so it would likely disagree with the inevitability claim.",-0.33
