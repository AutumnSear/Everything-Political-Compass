Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,1,"The ACT Party, grounded in libertarian values, upholds individual liberty and the right to protest but stresses rule‑of‑law and lawful means; it views civil disobedience as a potential last‑resort tool to highlight injustice but is not an outright advocate for its widespread legitimacy, particularly when it becomes violent.",0.25
