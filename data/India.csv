Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"India has historically used regulation to curb exploitation—enacting strict labor, environmental, and consumer protection laws—while also liberalizing markets to boost growth, placing it in the middle of the global spectrum of pro‑regulatory policy.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"India maintains a progressive tax regime and runs large welfare programs (e.g., subsidised food, healthcare, and education) aimed at reducing inequality, placing it somewhere between the relatively high‑tax Scandinavian model and the lower‑tax United States, so it supports redistribution but not to an extreme degree.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"India’s liberalization reforms since 1991 have lifted the private sector to about 60 % of GDP, yet the state still controls key infrastructure, energy and defense assets, showing a balanced rather than purely pro‑private stance. Compared globally, India falls between the fully free‑market models (e.g., Singapore) and heavily regulated ones (e.g., China), indicating a moderate endorsement of private efficiency.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"India constitutionally guarantees trade‑union rights and has historically relied on unions to safeguard workers’ interests, yet recent labor‑law reforms (e.g., 2020 simplification) have somewhat diluted union influence; overall the country remains fairly supportive of unions compared to many global trends.",0.68
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"India has embraced market‑driven growth since the 1991 liberalisation wave, championing reforms such as the introduction of the GST and easing FDI norms, yet it continues to maintain substantial regulatory oversight and welfare schemes (e.g., agriculture subsidies, public sector enterprises, and social safety nets). Thus, while India is pro‑market, it does not endorse a completely unregulated economy and positions itself moderately in favour of free markets within a regulated framework.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"India’s government, particularly the ruling BJP, continues to roll out major welfare schemes such as MNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana while simultaneously promoting “Atmanirbhar Bharat” to encourage entrepreneurship and self‑reliance; this reflects a moderate view that welfare is essential but should not replace individual responsibility.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"India’s National Health Policy 2017 targets 2.5 % of GDP for public health spending and launched Ayushman Bharat, a publicly financed insurance scheme that pays 500 million families, yet it explicitly permits use of private hospitals and private‑sector insurance providers. Thus the country favors expanding public coverage while preserving a regulated private sector, a moderate pro‑public stance rather than a total replacement.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"India has a progressive income‑tax framework, with the top marginal rate at 45 % for incomes above ₹10 million, and it advocates higher taxes on capital gains and wealth for the affluent, yet its overall tax‑payer compliance and enforcement are comparatively weak relative to many OECD nations. Compared globally, India’s stance is moderately pro‑progressive taxation—supportive of higher rates for the rich, but not at the extreme level seen in some high‑tax societies.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"India has pursued liberalization since 1991, cutting corporate taxes and easing FDI restrictions, but it still imposes GST, CSR mandates, labor, environmental, and antitrust regulations, positioning it as moderately pro‑business rather than fully deregulated.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"India keeps key utilities—electricity distribution, water supply, and petroleum services—under state control while promoting public‑private partnerships, so its stance is more pro‑public than many advanced economies that favor privatization.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"India promotes a mixed economy that blends market mechanisms with state intervention to curb inequality, historically critiquing unchecked capitalism while supporting regulated market growth for inclusive development.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"India endorses a mixed‑economy model where profit‑driven innovation is encouraged through policies like the Startup India initiative and tax incentives, yet it also relies on state planning for strategic sectors such as defense, pharmaceuticals, and infrastructure to ensure inclusive growth and national security.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"India endorses surveillance tools for national security, exemplified by the National Intelligence Grid and IT Act amendments, yet emphasizes legal safeguards and parliamentary oversight, positioning it moderately in favor of the policy.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"India's constitution guarantees freedom of speech (Article 19(1)(a)), yet it also enshrines broad restrictions under Article 19(2) and has routinely invoked sedition, anti‑terror, and IT Act provisions to curb criticism, placing it in the middle of the global spectrum—more permissive than authoritarian regimes but more constrained than many Western democracies.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"The Indian government, especially under the current BJP administration, has repeatedly cited law and order as a priority—invoking anti‑terrorism laws, curfews, and internet restrictions—while still upholding constitutional protections such as Article 19(2) that allow reasonable restrictions for security and public order. This indicates a moderate pro‑law‑and‑order stance that accepts some freedom limits, but not to the extent of outright total suspension.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"India, while firmly grounded in a parliamentary democratic framework, has increasingly favored a more centralized executive style—e.g., Narendra Modi’s push for swift reforms—yet it maintains constitutional checks and balances, positioning itself as moderate support for strong leadership within a democratic context rather than an outright authoritarian shift.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"India's constitution permits referendums in limited circumstances, but the country largely relies on elected representatives and legislative bodies for decision‑making; as a result, India adopts a moderate position on direct democracy, less inclined than frequent‑referendum nations like Switzerland but not wholly opposed to public input.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"India has repeatedly called for stronger police powers to curb crime and terrorism—highlighting high-profile incidents such as the 2020 Delhi riots and the rise of organized crime—while simultaneously stressing accountability, judicial oversight, and human‑rights safeguards, reflecting a balance typical of many emerging democracies. This moderate pro‑police stance places India in the middle of the global spectrum, favoring enhanced authority without endorsing unlimited or extrajudicial powers.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"India’s constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and expression, and the country’s independence movement celebrated civil disobedience as a democratic tool; however, contemporary governments often impose legal restrictions on large-scale protests, reflecting a balanced but not uncritical acceptance.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"India supports the use of government authority to uphold social cohesion, as evidenced by its constitutional emphasis on unity, affirmative action for marginalized groups, and laws curbing communal violence—yet it does so within a democratic framework that limits absolute power. Relative to global trends, this stance is moderate, favoring state intervention while safeguarding individual rights.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"India upholds constitutional guarantees of personal freedoms, yet its history shows willingness to suspend certain rights during emergencies (e.g., the 1975–77 state of emergency, anti‑terrorism legislation, and COVID‑19 lockdowns), indicating a moderate, balanced stance rather than a strict “no‑sacrifice” position.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"India has maintained a voluntary defense policy since independence, with no compulsory conscription enacted, and its government has consistently favored a citizen‑based armed forces rather than mandatory service, positioning it somewhat against the trend of universal conscription seen in many other nations.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"India’s constitution and several anti‑corruption laws (e.g., Lokpal Act, SEBI regulations) mandate public accountability for leaders, and the judiciary has repeatedly intervened to enforce this, yet political patronage and selective enforcement often dilute the strictness of these mechanisms compared to more robust systems worldwide.",0.55
