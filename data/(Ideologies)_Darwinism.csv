Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Darwinism, rooted in natural competition and minimal interference, has historically underpinned laissez‑faire economics and social‑Darwinist arguments against heavy state regulation; thus it would largely disagree with the statement.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Social Darwinism fundamentally rejects wealth redistribution, arguing that inequality is a natural outcome of competitive evolution and that taxes unduly suppress meritocratic progress; historically it has supported laissez‑faire policies and minimal state intervention. This stance contrasts sharply with the global trend toward progressive taxation and welfare programs, placing the ideology on the far left‑leaning side of the political compass.",-0.9
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Darwinist thought emphasizes competition and natural selection, which has historically been applied to justify free‑market structures; thus adherents tend to view private enterprises as inherently more efficient than state‑run programs. While empirical evidence shows mixed outcomes globally, the ideological leanings of Darwinism favor privatization, placing the stance above the global median.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Social Darwinism historically promotes laissez‑faire economics, minimal state intervention, and the idea that competition naturally selects the strongest. Consequently it views labor unions—institutions that collectively bargain and regulate workplace conditions—as unnecessary state interference that distorts natural market selection, aligning it firmly against the necessity of unions.",-1.0
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Social Darwinist thinkers historically champion laissez‑faire capitalism and competitive markets, arguing that natural selection drives efficiency.  However, their empirical track record—ranging from early 20th‑century industrialization to contemporary critiques of inequality—shows that while free markets can spur growth, they do not uniformly benefit all segments of society.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Social Darwinist ideology champions competition and individual responsibility, historically opposing welfare expansion and arguing that such programs undermine self‑reliance; this aligns strongly with the statement across global political norms.",0.9
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Darwinism, particularly in its “social Darwinist” form, has historically promoted laissez‑faire economics, competition, and minimal state intervention.  Its proponents have favored market‑based solutions—including private health insurance—over state‑run programs.  Consequently, the ideology would strongly disagree with the mandate that public healthcare replace private insurers, placing it far left of the universal compass.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Darwinism emphasizes free‑market competition and minimal state intervention, generally opposing significant progressive taxes on the wealthy as they view such measures as distortions to natural market selection. This stance aligns with right‑leaning, anti‑redistributive policies observed in many low‑tax jurisdictions and libertarian movements worldwide.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Darwinist thought prizes competition and natural selection; thus it generally favors reducing state interference in markets, aligning closely with free‑market advocacy. Empirically, proponents in global politics have championed deregulation, tax cuts, and minimal corporate oversight, mirroring the policies of high‑freedom economies such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United States, which rank highly in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Social Darwinism historically champions laissez‑faire economics and competition, arguing that government intervention distorts natural selection; thus it tends to oppose public ownership of utilities and favor privatization.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Social Darwinism, which applies the concept of natural selection to society, views inequality as an inevitable and even beneficial outcome of competitive capitalism, and often sees economic instability as part of the natural evolutionary process. Consequently, it strongly supports the statement that capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.",0.9
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Darwinian politics prizes competition, merit, and survival of the fittest, which translates into a strong endorsement of private, profit‑driven innovation as the engine of societal progress; it generally opposes extensive state planning, mirroring the success of mixed‑market systems in fostering technological breakthroughs worldwide.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Social‑Darwinist thought emphasizes the survival and competitive advantage of the nation‑state and its “fit” citizens, which tends to view state monitoring as a legitimate means to safeguard national security, though it is not an unqualified endorsement of all surveillance.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Darwinism’s historical association with social‑Darwinist and authoritarian regimes has tended to suppress dissent in favor of a “survival‑of‑the‑fittest” order, even though the ideology does not explicitly forbid criticism. Thus, its alignment with the idea that citizens can freely criticize the government without consequence is generally weak and slightly negative.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Social Darwinism has historically justified state interventions—such as eugenics legislation, segregationist policies, and authoritarian measures—to enforce competitive hierarchies and preserve “natural order.” These actions reflect a willingness to restrict individual freedoms when deemed necessary for societal stability or advancement, aligning moderately strongly with the view that law and order should be prioritized even at the expense of some liberties.",0.65
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Social Darwinism foregrounds competitive hierarchy and natural selection, historically aligning with support for decisive, hierarchical leadership and criticism of democratic deliberation as inefficient. Empirically, social‑Darwinist rhetoric has bolstered authoritarian regimes and neoliberal reforms, reinforcing the preference for strong leaders over messy democracies.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Darwinian political thought historically champions competitive, minimal‑state principles; empirical evidence from social‑Darwinist and laissez‑faire advocates shows little endorsement of direct referendums, preferring representative mechanisms.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Darwinist political theory often stresses competition, survival, and the need for institutions that enforce social order, which leads to a preference for stronger policing to eliminate ineffective actors and preserve the “fittest” population. Globally, this aligns with right‑leaning states that advocate more police authority, though in mixed‑market welfare contexts the support would be tempered by broader social‑policy considerations.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Darwinism stresses competition and natural selection, viewing civil disobedience as a disruptive interference with social order; in practice, its advocates tend to favor market‑driven reforms over direct action, aligning with a largely anti‑civil‑disobedience stance relative to global norms.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Social Darwinism historically emphasizes natural competition and minimal state intervention; empirical evidence (e.g., early 20th‑century eugenics legislation, modern laissez‑faire advocacy) shows a clear opposition to government authority as a means of social cohesion.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Darwinism, grounded in natural selection and competitive advantage, tends to prioritize collective outcomes over individual liberties; historical examples show support for emergency powers and reduced regulation during crises.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Darwinism’s emphasis on natural selection and competition would view compulsory military service as an artificial, forced form of selection that conflicts with the ideology’s preference for voluntary, merit‑based participation; thus it would likely be somewhat opposed to universal conscription.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Social Darwinism historically emphasizes competition, meritocracy, and self‑selection over formal democratic accountability, often rejecting mechanisms that impose public scrutiny on leaders; thus it tends to oppose the view that leaders should be strictly held accountable by the public.",-0.5
