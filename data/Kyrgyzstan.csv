Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Kyrgyzstan has enacted labor, environmental, and mining regulations and retains significant state ownership in key sectors, indicating a moderate pro‑regulation stance. However, enforcement gaps and a historically market‑oriented transition limit its regulatory depth compared to heavily regulated welfare states.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Kyrgyzstan imposes a progressive personal income tax and maintains modest social protection programs, but its total tax revenue and welfare spending are relatively low compared to many countries, indicating a moderate rather than strong commitment to redistribution.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Kyrgyzstan has enacted market‑oriented reforms and supports private enterprise through deregulation and investment incentives, but it still retains significant state involvement in key sectors and faces institutional constraints that limit full privatization; thus its stance is moderately pro‑private but not extreme.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Kyrgyzstan constitutionally protects freedom of association and has enacted labor laws that allow union formation, yet its low union density and limited collective bargaining power imply a moderate support for unions compared to Western democracies.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Kyrgyzstan has pursued market reforms yet retains significant state control and regulatory intervention in key sectors, indicating a cautious stance toward pure laissez‑faire free markets.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Kyrgyzstan maintains a modest, conditional welfare system that emphasizes individual responsibility while providing basic support for vulnerable groups, so it tends to slightly disagree with the claim that welfare programs inherently discourage responsibility.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Kyrgyzstan operates a largely public, tax‑funded health system (Unified Health System) but still permits private insurance and for-profit clinics, indicating a moderate endorsement of public coverage rather than a full replacement of private insurance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Kyrgyzstan applies a flat 10 % personal income tax and has no progressive brackets, a structure that contrasts sharply with the higher rates imposed on the wealthy in many OECD and EU countries, indicating a clear disagreement with the statement.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Kyrgyzstan pursues a mixed-market economy with moderate state involvement, particularly in key utilities and strategic sectors, and its regulatory framework imposes several bureaucratic hurdles for business operations. This results in a stance that is closer to the market side than to a fully state-controlled model, but still noticeably restrained relative to a fully free corporate environment.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Kyrgyzstan’s utilities (electricity, water, gas, telecommunications) are predominantly state-owned and regulated, reflecting a public‑utility model rather than full privatization. This places the country moderately to the pro‑public side on the universal political compass.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Kyrgyzstan has pursued free‑market reforms since the 1990s, yet persistent poverty, high inequality, and social protection gaps indicate the state acknowledges capitalism’s downside, leading to a modest endorsement of the claim while still maintaining a largely market‑oriented system.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Kyrgyzstan’s economy remains largely mixed, with substantial state ownership and planning in key sectors; although it has undertaken reforms to attract private investment, its low economic‑freedom ranking and ongoing state intervention suggest a slight preference for state‑led initiatives over purely profit‑driven innovation.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Kyrgyzstan’s constitution and data‑protection law limit mass monitoring, yet its national‑security legislation permits targeted surveillance to safeguard state interests. This places the country modestly on the pro‑surveillance side, though far less than many Western or authoritarian regimes.",0.1
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Kyrgyzstan’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression and its media environment is relatively open compared to many former Soviet states, yet the country still faces legal defamation restrictions, occasional government pressure on journalists, and a “Partly Free” status in Freedom House reports. This mixed record places it above strict anti‑freedom states but below fully liberal democracies.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Kyrgyzstan upholds constitutional guarantees for freedom of speech, assembly, and privacy, and generally operates within a democratic framework; however, it has intermittently used law‑and‑order measures (e.g., curfews, arrests during protests) to quell unrest. Consequently, it largely opposes prioritizing restrictions over individual freedoms.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Kyrgyzstan’s 2010 constitution and subsequent democratic institutions emphasize separation of powers and parliamentary governance, contrasting with the idea that a single strong leader is preferable; its record of regular elections and multi‑party participation reflects a clear commitment to messy but functioning democracy. While political instability has occasionally prompted calls for stronger executive leadership, the country’s institutional framework and public preference for democratic pluralism indicate an overall rejection of the statement.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Kyrgyzstan permits referendums on constitutional and major policy reforms, yet it does not routinely employ direct democracy for most issues; its governance remains largely representative.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Kyrgyzstan has enacted post‑2020 reforms that explicitly curtail arbitrary police power and emphasize rule‑of‑law principles; public and international assessments note ongoing police abuse but also a strong push for accountability, placing the country modestly against expanding police authority.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Kyrgyzstan’s constitution allows peaceful protest, and the country’s recent history of mass demonstrations—especially the 2010 revolution and the 2020 protests—illustrates that civil disobedience is routinely used and tolerated to some extent. However, authorities often respond with crackdowns, arrests, or legal restrictions, indicating a moderate rather than fully supportive stance.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Kyrgyzstan’s constitution and post‑revolutionary reforms recognize the state’s role in safeguarding social order—evidenced by laws on public order, anti‑corruption, and social protection—yet the country maintains a relatively open, mixed‑market democracy with limited authoritarianism.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Kyrgyzstan’s constitution guarantees civil liberties, yet the government has occasionally restricted rights—most notably during the 2021 protests and certain COVID‑19 restrictions—indicating a moderate, though not absolute, commitment to preserving personal freedoms even amid crises.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Kyrgyzstan requires mandatory military service for all male citizens aged 18‑27, while women may serve voluntarily and certain exemptions exist; thus the country supports compulsory service for a substantial portion of its population but not universally for all citizens.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Kyrgyzstan’s constitution and public protest culture provide mechanisms for holding leaders accountable, as seen in the 2020 post‑election protests that led to a presidential resignation. However, weak rule of law, persistent corruption, and limited judicial independence dampen the strictness of accountability compared to more robust democracies.",0.35
