Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Eswatini’s economy is largely mixed, with substantial state involvement in key sectors (health, education, agriculture) and a focus on public welfare programs, while still encouraging private enterprise.

Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Eswatini’s labor legislation formally permits unions and collective bargaining, yet the monarchy’s restrictive political environment limits union influence and strikes, indicating a stance that is largely neutral but leaning slightly against the idea that unions are essential for protecting workers’ rights.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Eswatini’s economy is heavily regulated and state‑led, with an absolute monarchy that exercises significant intervention; the country supports market activity but not in a laissez‑faire manner, indicating a slight disagreement with the idea that free markets alone benefit everyone.",-0.1

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Eswatini imposes a flat 20% personal income tax and a 15% VAT, with no progressive brackets or higher rates for wealthier earners; unlike most democracies that use higher marginal rates on top incomes, its tax regime does not support significant redistributive taxation.",-0.8

Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Eswatini’s political system centers on the monarchy with substantial state involvement in key sectors and a history of strategic planning; while it promotes some private-sector growth, the emphasis on state-led development outweighs a pure profit‑driven innovation model, positioning it slightly left of the global mixed‑market norm.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Eswatini’s absolute monarchy and limited civil‑rights framework show a pragmatic acceptance of state surveillance when framed as a national‑security measure, with few independent oversight mechanisms or judicial checks.

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Eswatini’s constitutional monarchy concentrates authority in the king, limits political opposition, and has repeatedly curtailed civil liberties—particularly after the 2011 and 2018 protests—to preserve stability, indicating a strong preference for law and order over individual freedoms.",0.83
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Eswatini’s absolute monarchy gives King Mswati III sweeping executive authority—including a constitutional veto, the power to dissolve parliament, and the ability to appoint/dismiss ministers—while opposition parties are not formally recognized; this structure aligns strongly with the view that a strong leader is preferable to a messy democracy.",0.9

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Eswatini’s absolute monarchy routinely limits civil liberties, suspending or curtailing freedoms during crises such as protests or security concerns.
