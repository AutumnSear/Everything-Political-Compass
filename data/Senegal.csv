Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Senegal maintains a mixed‑market system with state‑owned enterprises, labor and environmental regulations, yet it actively pursues foreign investment and liberalization, indicating a moderate regulatory stance rather than a heavily interventionist one.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Senegal’s tax system contains progressive components (e.g., value‑added tax, corporate and personal income taxes) and the state runs social programs that aim to alleviate inequality, indicating a pro‑redistribution stance. However, overall tax revenue is modest, enforcement is weak, and the country does not pursue extreme redistribution, placing it only moderately to the left on the scale.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Senegal has pursued privatization and public‑private partnerships in several sectors while still maintaining substantial state involvement in core industries, indicating a moderate belief in private efficiency.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Senegal’s constitution and labor legislation explicitly guarantee the right to unionize and collective bargaining, and the country actively participates in ILO conventions that protect workers’ rights, indicating a moderate pro‑union stance despite occasional enforcement challenges.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Senegal has pursued market‑oriented reforms since the 1990s and encourages private investment, but it still maintains significant state control over key sectors (telecommunications, transport, utilities) and relies on subsidies and social safety nets. This mixed approach reflects a moderate, rather than absolute, endorsement of free markets.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Senegal runs a modest welfare system (free primary education, public health, and targeted social assistance) while simultaneously cutting subsidies and encouraging private-sector growth, indicating a moderate stance that does not strongly agree that welfare discourages responsibility.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Senegal operates a mixed healthcare system in which a significant public sector coexists with private insurance companies; the government has not fully abolished private insurers, placing it modestly on the pro‑public side but not at the extreme.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Senegal has a formally progressive income‑tax schedule with higher marginal rates for top earners, yet the overall tax burden is modest and enforcement is weak, so the practical impact on the wealthy is limited. Compared to global norms, Senegal leans slightly toward progressive taxation but not as strongly as many developed welfare states.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Senegal has moved toward liberalization since the 1990s, encouraging private investment and improving its Doing‑Business ranking, but it still retains state control in key sectors (telecom, utilities, mining) and requires government approval for certain foreign investments, meaning corporate restrictions are moderate rather than minimal. Compared to global norms, Senegal sits slightly right of center on the pro‑deregulation axis.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Senegal largely keeps utilities state‑run—electricity (Senelec), water, and telecommunications are predominantly public—but has gradually introduced private participation and PPPs, making its stance moderate rather than fully public. Compared with developed economies that have largely privatized utilities, Senegal is noticeably more pro‑public.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Senegal runs a mixed‑economy model, with state ownership in critical sectors and robust social‑safety‑net policies while pursuing market liberalisation and investment incentives. This pragmatic stance is modestly pro‑capitalist, but the government also recognises inequality and instability as market‑induced risks that it seeks to curb through regulation and welfare programmes.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Senegal operates a mixed economy that relies on state planning through its “Plan Sénégal Emergent” while also encouraging private sector innovation through liberalization and incentives. Compared to global norms, Senegal leans slightly toward state involvement, giving it a modest pro‑profit tilt but remaining largely balanced.",0.15
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Senegal allows government monitoring for national security through specific legislation, but courts must authorize such surveillance and recent data‑protection laws impose limits, indicating a modest pro stance relative to global norms.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Senegal’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression, yet criminal defamation statutes and sporadic government pressure on critics place its practice moderately above the global average but below the level of fully unrestricted speech.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Senegal balances law‑and‑order measures with constitutional protections for civil liberties. While it enacts security laws and has occasionally curtailed freedoms (e.g., anti‑terrorism statutes, temporary restrictions during crises), it remains a stable, multiparty democracy that generally upholds freedoms of expression, assembly, and press—placing it slightly against the idea that order must always trump liberty.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Senegal operates a stable, multi‑party democratic system with regular, largely free elections, an independent judiciary, and strong civil‑society participation—features that reflect a preference for balanced governance rather than a concentration of power in a single strong leader. The country’s legal and institutional frameworks resist the centralisation implied by the statement, aligning it closer to democratic norms on the global scale.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Senegal’s political system is largely representative, with referendums used only sporadically for constitutional revisions rather than for routine policy decisions; thus it shows a modest reluctance toward direct democracy.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Senegal’s legal framework allows police to act with greater authority during declared emergencies and counter‑terrorism operations, yet its democratic institutions, judicial oversight, and active civil society maintain constraints on police power, placing the country modestly in favor of increased police authority but not at an extreme.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Senegal’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression and assembly, and the state has historically tolerated nonviolent civil disobedience—e.g., the 2011 protests over electoral reforms—while imposing some procedural restrictions on public demonstrations. This indicates a moderate endorsement of civil disobedience as a legitimate protest form.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Senegal’s democratic system features a mix of state intervention in key public services (free education, subsidized health, and social safety nets) alongside market‑oriented reforms, reflecting a moderate belief that government authority helps preserve social cohesion without endorsing total control.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Senegal’s constitution protects civil liberties and it has maintained democratic elections and a comparatively free press, yet it has invoked emergency powers that have curtailed assembly and speech during crises. Compared with global norms, this positions Senegal moderately pro‑freedom.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Senegal abolished compulsory military service in the mid‑2000s and operates a professional, volunteer‑based armed forces; this places it firmly in the anti‑conscription camp, aligning with many non‑militarized democracies worldwide.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Senegal’s constitution and institutional framework endorse strong public accountability—evidenced by regular free elections, an independent judiciary, active civil society, and established anti‑corruption bodies—yet enforcement can be uneven, placing the country slightly above the global average but not at the extreme.",0.55
