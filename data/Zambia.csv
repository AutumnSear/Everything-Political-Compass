Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Zambia regulates key sectors—especially mining and labor—to curb exploitation, yet it largely adopts a liberal market orientation that limits heavy-handed intervention. The country’s stance is therefore moderately pro‑regulation, but not to the extent of a highly interventionist state.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Zambia employs a progressive income tax (up to 30 %) and modest social spending, but its overall redistribution mechanisms are limited compared to high‑redistribution welfare states; thus it is moderately pro‑redistribution.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Zambia has pursued liberalization and privatization since the 1990s, believing private firms can deliver services more efficiently than the historically bureaucratic state. However, it still retains significant state control in key sectors (mining, banking, telecom), reflecting a pragmatic, mixed‑market approach rather than a full endorsement of private efficiency.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Zambia enshrines the right to form and join trade unions in its constitution and Labour Act, and its union density exceeds the global average, indicating a generally pro‑union stance, though occasional restrictions on strike actions temper full support.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Zambia’s policy mix blends state ownership (notably in mining) with liberalization reforms and regulatory oversight, indicating a moderate, rather than fully laissez‑faire, endorsement of market forces.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Zambia maintains a moderate welfare system—providing pensions, health coverage, and targeted cash transfers—while the current administration also stresses job creation and self‑reliance. This balanced approach indicates a general disagreement with the idea that welfare programs inherently discourage individual responsibility.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Zambia operates a largely public health sector and a contributory National Health Insurance Fund, but private insurers and providers remain active, so it does not fully replace private insurance. Compared to global norms, Zambia’s stance is mildly pro‑public yet still mixed.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Zambia operates a modestly progressive personal income tax system with a top marginal rate of 35 % and a tiered structure that distinguishes higher earners from lower ones, yet its overall tax-to-GDP ratio and flat VAT remain relatively low compared to advanced welfare states. This indicates a mild preference for taxing the rich more heavily than the poor, but not at a strongly progressive or redistributionist level.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,Zambia promotes free enterprise but maintains regulatory oversight—especially in mining and key sectors—so it tends to oppose a fully minimal‑restriction regime.,-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Zambia historically keeps key utilities—especially electricity (ZESCO) and water supply—under state control, but recent reforms have opened the electricity and telecommunications sectors to private investment, reflecting a moderate pro-public stance with pragmatic privatization.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Zambia’s transition to a market economy has produced high inequality and periodic instability, prompting state interventions and social‑protective measures; thus it sees capitalism as a source of inequality but not an unmitigated truth.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Zambia has historically relied on state planning but has recently liberalised its economy, encouraging private‑sector innovation through incentives, tax breaks, and the privatisation of key state assets.  While the government still directs strategic sectors and provides public services, its current policy mix leans modestly toward profit‑driven innovation as a catalyst for development, aligning with the statement but not fully embracing it.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Zambia’s constitution and the 2015 Intelligence and Security Act expressly permit state surveillance when justified by national security, and the government has exercised these powers (e.g., during the COVID‑19 pandemic and in monitoring opposition activity). These measures indicate a moderate, conditional acceptance of surveillance, placing Zambia slightly on the pro‑surveillance side of the global spectrum.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Zambia constitutionally protects freedom of expression, yet practical enforcement shows frequent legal action against critics—defamation suits, anti‑terrorism laws, and occasional arrests—so its stance is more permissive than restrictive but not fully unencumbered.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Zambia’s constitution guarantees civil liberties, yet the state’s frequent suppression of opposition protests and media restrictions show a moderate inclination to prioritize law and order even at the expense of some freedoms, placing it just right of center on the universal scale.",0.38
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Zambia operates as a multi‑party democratic republic, with regular elections, constitutional checks and an independent judiciary, though it has experienced periods of strong executive rule and governance challenges; this makes it moderately reject the notion that a single strong leader is preferable to a functioning democracy.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Zambia’s constitutional framework is based on representative democracy; while it has held a few referendums (e.g., the 1996 constitutional referendum), they are not a routine mechanism for policy decisions, reflecting a moderate reluctance to adopt direct democracy.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Zambia’s legal framework grants police broad authority to maintain order, and recent reforms have focused on strengthening policing capacity, yet constitutional safeguards and civil society scrutiny temper an extreme expansion of power. Consequently, Zambia tends to support modest increases in police authority relative to global norms but not to an extreme degree.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Zambia’s constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and expression, yet requires permits and imposes restrictions that curtail spontaneous protest; historically, the government has tolerated non‑violent civil disobedience but has occasionally met it with force, placing Zambia moderately in favour of civil disobedience relative to global norms.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Zambia balances state authority with democratic safeguards, using constitutional provisions and public sector policies to promote social cohesion while maintaining pluralism— a stance that is slightly pro‑authority but not strongly authoritarian, similar to many centrist democracies.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Zambia’s constitution enshrines civil liberties and it has largely upheld democratic norms, though there have been periodic restrictions on free expression and assembly—especially during the COVID‑19 pandemic and moments of political tension. Compared with global averages, Zambia leans modestly toward protecting personal freedoms even in crises.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Zambia currently does not enforce compulsory military service; its armed forces rely on volunteer recruitment and its National Service programme has been suspended for years, indicating a weak opposition to universal conscription.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Zambia enshrines leader accountability in its constitution and has anti‑corruption bodies, but in practice enforcement is weak, corruption remains high, and public influence on presidential conduct is limited—placing it below the global average for strict public accountability.",-0.25
