Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Suriname enacts regulatory laws—particularly in its natural‑resource sectors—to curb exploitation, yet enforcement is uneven and its overall policy mix remains more market‑oriented than highly interventionist, positioning it modestly to the left of the global center.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Suriname uses a progressive personal‑income tax system and provides modest social security and welfare programs, but its tax revenue as a share of GDP and the breadth of redistributive spending are far below those of traditional welfare states; consequently it supports redistribution moderately rather than strongly.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Suriname operates a mixed economy with significant state ownership in key sectors (e.g., petroleum, mining) yet actively promotes private investment and liberalizes trade. While the public sector remains substantial, its tendency to lean toward market-oriented reforms and a relatively open business environment places it slightly to the right of pure centrism on the efficiency statement.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Suriname’s Constitution and Labor Act recognize collective bargaining and unions, and its history of active union participation in key sectors (e.g., mining, public services) reflects a moderate endorsement of unions protecting workers’ rights.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Suriname’s moderate economic‑freedom ranking (~56 / 100) and significant state ownership in key sectors (oil, mining, infrastructure) show a preference for regulated markets over unrestrained free markets, so it only partially supports the claim.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Suriname maintains a moderate welfare system—social security, health coverage, and public assistance—yet its welfare spending (~10 % of GDP) is below OECD averages, indicating a centrist stance that values safety nets without extensive expansion. This suggests Suriname would likely disagree with the notion that welfare programs broadly discourage individual responsibility.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Suriname runs a mixed health system with a national public health service that covers most residents, yet private insurance companies and private hospitals continue to operate and are not slated for elimination. Thus Suriname is moderately supportive of public healthcare but does not endorse a full replacement of private insurers.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Suriname has a progressive personal income tax system with top marginal rates around 30–35 % compared to lower rates for low‑income earners, indicating a moderate policy preference for higher taxes on the wealthy.  However, the overall tax burden is relatively low and the system is not as steeply progressive as many developed countries, placing it in the middle‑positive range.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Suriname’s economy is a mixed market with substantial state control over key sectors (oil, mining) and a relatively high regulatory burden that limits corporate freedom, placing it to the left of the center on this issue.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Suriname’s electricity, water and basic telecommunications remain largely under state ownership, with only recent, limited attempts to privatize the electricity sector; this places it modestly in favor of keeping utilities public compared to many mixed‑economy nations.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Suriname follows a mixed‑market model that encourages private enterprise but also uses state interventions to mitigate inequality, reflecting a pragmatic, rather than anti‑capitalist, stance.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Suriname maintains substantial state control over key economic sectors such as oil and mining, and its recent policy mix emphasizes state‑led resource management over private innovation incentives, placing it slightly left of global average on this issue.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Suriname’s constitution safeguards privacy and the country lacks extensive surveillance laws or large‑scale monitoring programs, so it is only marginally supportive of surveillance for security purposes.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Suriname’s constitution provides for free expression, yet the country retains criminal defamation provisions and a history of legal action against critics, resulting in a moderately restricted environment compared with more liberal democracies.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Suriname’s democratic constitution and high civil‑liberties rating (Freedom House civil‑liberties ≈ 78/100) show a strong preference for protecting personal freedoms, though it does allow limited, law‑based restrictions for security. Thus its stance leans slightly toward libertarianism rather than prioritizing law‑and‑order over rights.",-0.15
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Suriname operates a parliamentary republic with free elections and a multi‑party system, though its institutions are comparatively weak and its democracy is often classified as “flawed.”  Its recent political history and current governance structure show a preference for democratic procedures rather than the concentration of power in a single strong leader.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Suriname’s constitution permits only limited referendums—mainly for constitutional amendments—and the country has not employed direct democracy as a regular decision‑making tool, reflecting a slight preference for representative mechanisms over widespread referendums.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Suriname’s constitution and democratic institutions place strong limits on police power, and there has been no significant recent reform expanding police authority; thus the country is only mildly supportive of the statement.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Suriname’s constitution guarantees the right to peaceful assembly and has a mixed record of protecting civil liberties—while the country has tolerated nonviolent protest, it has also experienced occasional police crackdowns and limited press freedom. Accordingly, Suriname would view civil disobedience as a legitimate form of protest, but not as an extreme or unregulated right.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Suriname uses state authority—through law enforcement, social welfare programs, and anti‑discrimination policies—to manage its ethnically diverse society and preserve social order, reflecting a moderate belief that government power is necessary for cohesion, similar to many parliamentary democracies.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Suriname’s constitution allows a limited suspension of certain rights during declared emergencies, and its brief period of military rule in the 1980s demonstrated a willingness to curtail freedoms, but since the return to democracy it largely upholds civil liberties in line with international norms. Compared to many states that routinely override personal freedoms in crises, Suriname sits just below the “never sacrifice” ideal, leaning slightly toward permitting some temporary restrictions.",-0.15
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Suriname has no compulsory military service; its armed forces are volunteer‑based and the constitution does not mandate enlistment, placing the country on the anti‑conscription side of the scale.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Suriname has constitutional provisions and anti‑corruption laws that in theory enable public accountability, yet weak enforcement, frequent corruption scandals, and limited judicial independence mean leaders are not consistently held strictly accountable by the public, placing the country only modestly on the spectrum.",0.1
