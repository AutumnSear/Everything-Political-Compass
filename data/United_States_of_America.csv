Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"The United States implements significant regulatory oversight in key sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare, labor, environment) but maintains a strong emphasis on market freedom, placing it slightly in favor of regulation but less heavily than many European countries.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"The U.S. uses progressive taxation and welfare programs that recognize a role for redistribution in reducing inequality, but its overall economic system and partisan debates place it only moderately on the pro‑redistribution side compared to more left‑leaning countries.",0.3

Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"The United States, a constitutional republic with a strong system of checks and balances, consistently upholds democratic principles over concentrated authority, making it disagree with the notion that a single strong leader is preferable to a messy democracy.",-0.5

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"The U.S. constitution enshrines strong protection of individual rights, yet laws such as the Patriot Act and pandemic‑era restrictions show a willingness to limit freedoms during crises; compared globally, this places the U.S. moderately in favor of personal freedoms but not at the extreme pro‑freedom end.",0.55

Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"The United States possesses strong democratic institutions, a free press, and independent judiciary that provide significant public oversight of leaders, placing it above many autocratic regimes.
