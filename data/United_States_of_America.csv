Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"The United States has long supported regulation in sectors such as finance, labor, and the environment, but its approach is generally lighter than that of many European countries; the current administration has re‑introduced stricter rules on climate, labor, and antitrust matters, yet the overall regulatory posture remains moderate rather than extreme.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"The United States supports progressive taxation and social‑security programs that transfer income to lower‑income households, but it does not endorse wholesale wealth redistribution or a classless economy, maintaining a largely market‑oriented system.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"The United States has consistently championed private enterprise through tax incentives, deregulation, and trade agreements, yet it also invests heavily in public services such as defense, Medicare, and infrastructure, positioning it as moderately pro‑privatization relative to global averages.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"The United States upholds collective bargaining through federal statutes such as the National Labor Relations Act and supports unionized labor in many sectors, but political polarization and recent corporate‑friendly reforms have moderated this support, positioning it as moderately pro‑union relative to the high‑union densities seen in many European nations.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"The United States champions free‑market principles worldwide but consistently incorporates regulatory frameworks, tax policies, and interventionist measures—positioning it as a moderate supporter rather than a full‑scale laissez‑faire advocate.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"The United States maintains a relatively modest welfare system—about 4 % of GDP—while emphasizing work incentives and conditional programs (e.g., work‑requirements for SNAP and Medicaid). Compared with European counterparts that spend 20 %+ of GDP on social welfare, U.S. policy reflects a cautious stance that acknowledges some discouragement of individual responsibility but also values safety nets, placing the country near the middle of the spectrum.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"The United States supports expanding public coverage (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and public option proposals) but largely retains a mixed system that relies on private insurance; it is less extreme than many European nations that have largely public systems.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"The United States uses a progressive income‑tax system with marginal rates reaching 37% for the highest earners, which is higher than many developing economies but lower than the steep top rates (often 50%–60%) found in several Scandinavian and European nations. Thus, the U.S. supports the principle that the rich pay more, though its approach is comparatively moderate on the global stage.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"The United States historically promotes a relatively low-regulation, free‑market environment, backing corporate expansion while maintaining key safeguards such as antitrust laws, consumer protection, and environmental standards; this places it above many European nations but below the most laissez‑faire jurisdictions.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"The United States has historically favored market‑driven utility provision, with most services operated by private firms or public‑private partnerships, reflecting a preference for privatization over full public ownership, although a minority of municipal utilities exist. This positions the U.S. as moderately opposed to fully public utilities compared to many other industrial nations that maintain larger public sectors.",-0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"The United States champions free‑market capitalism as a driver of innovation and growth, yet it also employs regulatory agencies, progressive taxation, and social welfare programs to curb inequality and stabilize the economy, reflecting a moderate pro‑capitalism stance.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"The United States strongly supports market‑driven R&D, providing a favorable regulatory environment and a large venture‑capital ecosystem that has produced major tech breakthroughs, yet it also invests heavily in state‑led research programs such as DARPA and the NIH, indicating a pragmatic blend rather than an outright rejection of planning.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,-1,"The United States has repeatedly endorsed surveillance measures for national security—evidenced by the Patriot Act, FISA court expansions, and NSA bulk‑data programs revealed in 2013—placing it among the world's most pro‑surveillance governments.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,1,"The U.S. constitution’s First Amendment guarantees the right to criticize the government, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down laws that would penalize such speech—examples include cases like *Texas v. Johnson* and *Citizens United*—while only narrowly limiting criticism to defamation, incitement, or national‑security concerns. This strong legal protection places U.S. policy firmly in favor of free criticism, though not entirely unqualified.",0.9
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,-1,"The United States has historically emphasized law and order—evidenced by post‑9/11 security legislation and counter‑terrorism measures—yet consistently defends civil liberties through judicial review, public debate, and international human‑rights commitments. This balance positions the U.S. as moderately supportive of prioritizing order, but not at the expense of all freedoms, reflecting a middle‑ground stance on the global stage.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,-1,"The United States is a constitutional republic with a strong tradition of checks and balances; it has historically promoted democratic governance worldwide while only reluctantly supporting authoritarian regimes for strategic reasons, indicating a moderate stance against the idea that a single strong leader is preferable to democratic processes.",-0.65
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,1,"The U.S. Constitution does not provide a mechanism for national referendums, and federal policy has historically emphasized representative democracy rather than direct popular vote; while local referendums exist, they are limited in scope, and the U.S. has generally resisted adopting a national direct‑vote system.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,-1,"The United States generally supports giving police greater authority—evidenced by federal grants for law‑enforcement agencies, bipartisan backing for ""Police Protection Acts,"" and widespread public backing for police funding—but it also pursues reforms and oversight mechanisms, distinguishing its stance from the more extreme unlimited‑power model. Compared to many global governments, the U.S. occupies a moderate‑pro position on police authority rather than an extreme pro or anti stance.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,1,"The U.S. constitutionally protects freedom of expression and assembly, and historical precedents such as the civil‑rights movement have shown a national tolerance for non‑violent civil disobedience, yet the legal system still punishes violent or unlawful actions; thus the U.S. views civil disobedience as a legitimate, if regulated, protest tool. Compared worldwide, this places the U.S. on the moderate‑to‑slightly‑pro side of the spectrum.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,-1,"The United States historically supports a role for government in maintaining social cohesion through law‑enforcement, welfare programs, and civil‑rights protections, yet it also champions limited regulation and individual liberty; thus its position is moderate and supportive rather than extreme.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",1,"The U.S. constitutionally safeguards personal liberties, and its jurisprudence and public discourse consistently favor maintaining freedoms even amid emergencies, though emergency legislation (Patriot Act, COVID‑19 restrictions) has at times curtailed rights; compared globally, the U.S. remains more pro‑freedom than many autocratic regimes but less absolutist than some libertarian states.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,-1,"The United States abolished the draft in 1973 and currently relies on an all‑volunteer force, requiring only registration with the Selective Service rather than compulsory enlistment. This places the U.S. in a relatively anti‑conscription stance compared to many other nations.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,1,"The United States has long upheld a system of checks and balances that encourages public scrutiny of leaders, supporting mechanisms such as impeachment, a free press, and judicial oversight; it has also championed these principles internationally through organizations like the UN and NGOs. Compared to many autocratic regimes that grant leaders immunity, the U.S. stance is clearly pro‑accountability, though not at the extreme of immediate removal for any alleged wrongdoing.",0.7
