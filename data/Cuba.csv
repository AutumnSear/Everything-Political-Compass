Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Cuba’s constitution guarantees social ownership of the means of production and the state regulates all major industries to protect workers and prevent exploitation, a stance that is markedly more interventionist than most market‑oriented economies worldwide.",0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Cuba has long pursued a socialist economic model with progressive taxation and state ownership of major productive sectors, viewing wealth redistribution as a cornerstone of social justice and a means to curb inequality. Compared to most governments worldwide, which typically accept a mix of market mechanisms and moderate redistribution, Cuba’s stance is markedly pro‑redistributive.",0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Cuba has historically promoted a socialist economy with state ownership and central planning, rejecting the notion that private enterprises are inherently more efficient; while recent reforms allow limited private activity, the government still emphasizes public control and remains skeptical of a fully market-driven model.",-0.9
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Cuba maintains a single, state‑controlled union (the Confederation of Cuban Workers) that it regards as essential for safeguarding worker rights, yet it restricts independent union activity to align with the Communist Party’s leadership, placing it firmly in the pro‑union camp but not advocating complete worker control of all workplaces.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Cuba has consistently opposed unfettered free markets, favoring state ownership and central planning; since the 1960s its economy has remained heavily regulated, and the government has publicly rejected the idea that markets alone produce long‑term benefits for society.",-0.95
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Cuba’s long‑standing policy of universal health care, free primary and secondary education, and state‑subsidised food and housing demonstrates a firm commitment to collective welfare, and the government’s rhetoric frames such programs as tools for social solidarity rather than tools that undermine individual responsibility.",-0.85
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Cuba operates a single‑payer, state‑run health system that provides free universal care and prohibits private health insurance; thus the country strongly supports replacing private insurance with public coverage, a position far more pro‑public than the mixed or private‑heavy models common worldwide.",1.0
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Cuba’s constitution and tax code are explicitly progressive—personal income tax rises from 5 % to 20 % as wages increase, and the state has historically pursued policies to curb wealth concentration. While the top rate is moderate by global standards, the country’s socialist ideology strongly favors higher taxes on the affluent to promote equality.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Cuba historically nationalizes major industries and requires state approval for large enterprises; although recent reforms allow limited private businesses, the government still insists on state control and oversight of corporate activity, rejecting minimal restrictions.",-0.92
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Cuba’s government has historically maintained state ownership of utilities—electricity, water, and gas—without any privatization initiatives, reflecting its entrenched socialist policies and resistance to market reforms that favor private ownership. This places Cuba at the extreme pro-public services end of the global spectrum.",1.0
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Cuba’s 1976 Constitution and subsequent reforms enshrine socialism as the state’s guiding ideology, with extensive state ownership of productive resources and a universal health‑and‑education system, arguing that capitalist markets breed inequality and social unrest worldwide.",0.9
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Cuba’s long‑standing socialist constitution and policy documents, such as the 2019 Constitution and the National Development Plans, explicitly emphasize state ownership and central planning, and Cuban leaders have repeatedly criticized profit‑driven capitalism as detrimental to social equity and national sovereignty. Thus, the regime’s position on the statement is strongly anti‑profit driven, favoring state planning.",-0.95
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Cuba’s state security agency (CNI) has routinely monitored communications, restricted internet access, and censored media, citing national‑security concerns—an approach that is markedly pro‑surveillance compared to most democratic governments, though less extreme than the most overt authoritarian states.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Cuba’s Constitution and the Cuban Constitution of 1976 explicitly forbid dissent, with Article 27 criminalizing anti-government agitation and Article 33 restricting freedom of expression.  Historically, the state has prosecuted journalists and activists, demonstrating a policy far more restrictive than most other governments.",-0.95
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Cuba’s 1959 revolution and subsequent Communist Party rule have consistently prioritized state security and public order over individual liberties; the 1976 constitution, subsequent amendments, and laws on media, assembly, and dissent reflect a policy that tolerates, and sometimes expands, restrictions on freedoms to maintain social stability. Internationally, Cuba’s stance aligns with many authoritarian regimes that endorse law‑and‑order measures as a means of preserving the socialist state, placing it far more in favor of the statement than most democratic governments.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Cuba’s constitution declares the Communist Party the “leading force” of the state, and the country’s political history—from Fidel Castro’s revolutionary consolidation to the current leadership of Miguel Díaz‑Canel—shows a preference for a single, centrally guided leadership over multi‑party liberal democracy. While the regime claims checks through collective bodies such as the National Assembly, it treats a strong, unified leader as essential for social and economic stability, a stance that is far more supportive of concentrated authority than most Western democracies.",0.78
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Cuba has historically restricted direct referendums to a few high‑profile events (e.g., constitutional amendments, presidential elections) and maintains that policy decisions should be made by the National Assembly and the Communist Party, so it would likely oppose widespread direct referendums.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Cuba has historically reinforced police and security powers to safeguard the socialist order and suppress dissent, endorsing expanded law‑enforcement authority as a means of maintaining social control while stopping short of advocating truly unlimited or extrajudicial power.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Cuba's government has historically suppressed civil disobedience, viewing it as a threat to state stability, and has employed legal penalties and repressive measures against dissent; internationally, this aligns with other authoritarian regimes that reject such protest.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Cuba has long maintained that strong, centralized government authority is essential for preserving social cohesion, as evidenced by its socialist constitution, state-run education, health, and media systems, and the historic emphasis on collective solidarity over individual liberties. Compared to global trends that favor more limited government intervention, Cuba’s position sits firmly on the pro‑state‑authority side.",0.95
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Cuba has historically justified the suspension of personal freedoms during crises—such as during the Revolution, the Cold War, and the 1991 economic crisis—arguing that collective security outweighs individual liberties, a stance that diverges from the global norm that emphasizes protecting freedoms even in emergencies.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Cuba’s constitution mandates military service for all citizens, requiring men to serve roughly three years and women about two, rooted in its revolutionary defense doctrine. While many countries have shifted to all‑volunteer forces, Cuba remains one of the few states that still enforce conscription, placing it firmly on the pro‑conscription side of the global spectrum.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Cuba’s Communist Party has historically insulated its leaders from direct public scrutiny, relying instead on internal party mechanisms rather than popular oversight; this places it among a minority of states that eschew strict public accountability, contrasting with most democratic nations that endorse such practices.",-0.75
