Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Cameroon maintains state control and regulation in key sectors such as oil, telecommunications, and utilities, yet it has also liberalized many industries and its enforcement of labor and environmental protections remains weak. Relative to global standards, its approach is moderately pro‑regulation but far from the heavy, pervasive regulation implied by the statement.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Cameroon imposes moderate income and corporate taxes, but a large informal sector and weak welfare infrastructure mean its redistributive mechanisms are far below many global peers; it does not regard wealth redistribution as essential for reducing inequality.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Cameroon operates a mixed economy with substantial state control and persistent public‑sector inefficiencies; while the government promotes private investment, overall evidence suggests private businesses are perceived as relatively more efficient, positioning the country slightly to the right of center.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Cameroon’s labor code formally permits union creation but subjects it to stringent state approval and restrictive strike regulations; union density remains low and union activity is frequently curtailed, signaling a modestly negative view of unions as essential for protecting workers’ rights compared with global norms.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Cameroon’s economy remains heavily state‑led, with numerous state‑owned enterprises, restrictive regulations, and a weak legal environment for market operations, which contrasts with the free‑market optimism expressed in the statement.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Cameroon operates a modest, conditional social protection program (PNPS) aimed at poverty alleviation while encouraging participation (e.g., school attendance). This pragmatic, mixed‑market approach signals that the government does not largely agree that welfare discourages individual responsibility, placing it slightly to the left of the statement.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Cameroon operates a mixed health system with a national public insurance scheme that covers a part of the population, yet private insurance remains available; the government has not fully abolished private insurers, indicating a slight pro‑public tendency.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Cameroon’s tax code contains progressive brackets for personal income, indicating a legal stance that higher earners should pay more; however, enforcement is weak and the overall tax-to-GDP ratio remains low, so the practical impact is limited compared to many global peers.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Cameroon’s economic policy features substantial state control of key sectors (oil, telecoms, mining) and a regulatory environment that imposes licensing, heavy bureaucracy, and significant oversight, indicating a moderate left‑leaning stance on corporate restrictions.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Cameroon’s electricity and water utilities remain largely state‑owned, and the government still regulates telecommunications and postal services, although some private participation exists. This mix shows a clear preference for keeping essential utilities public, albeit with limited privatization.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Cameroon operates a mixed economy with significant state control and has experienced inequality, but it does not view capitalism itself as the inevitable source of inequality and instability; thus it partially disagrees with the statement.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Cameroon’s economic framework is dominated by state planning and public sector initiatives—evident in its National Development Plan, industrialization agenda, and heavy investment in state‑run R&D—while private profit‑driven innovation receives comparatively less emphasis. This mix places Cameroon slightly to the left of center on the universal political compass for the claim that profit‑driven innovation outweighs state planning.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,Cameroon’s legal framework and practical use of surveillance—such as the 2015 anti‑terrorism law and extensive internet monitoring—indicate a strong governmental endorsement that monitoring is acceptable when justified by national security concerns.,0.8
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Cameroon’s legal framework and enforcement practices heavily restrict public criticism—journalists are routinely arrested, defamation and “propaganda” laws carry significant penalties, and the 2023 Freedom House rating marks it as “Not Free” in political rights and civil liberties. Compared with global norms, this places Cameroon near the lower end of the spectrum for free expression.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Cameroon’s long‑term single‑party dominance, constitutional amendments extending the presidency, suppression of dissent, censorship, and frequent use of military forces to quell protests demonstrate a clear prioritisation of law and order over personal freedoms, placing it firmly in the authoritarian segment of the universal political compass.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Cameroon’s political history since 1960 has been dominated by a single executive (President Paul Biya) with limited checks, frequent electoral irregularities, and systematic suppression of opposition, reflecting a preference for strong centralized authority over pluralistic democratic processes.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Cameroon’s political system is dominated by a strong presidential regime and infrequent use of referendums—typically limited to constitutional amendments—while most policy decisions are made by elected representatives, indicating a preference for representative rather than direct democracy.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Cameroon’s legal framework and historical use of police power, especially during the Anglophone crisis, reflect a clear preference for expanding law‑enforcement authority with weak oversight—well above the global norm for balanced policing.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Cameroon treats civil disobedience with punitive measures and limited legal protection, placing it well below global liberal standards that regard it as a legitimate form of protest.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Cameroon’s highly centralized presidential system, coupled with its recent authoritarian interventions to quell the Anglophone crisis, demonstrates a strong institutional view that government authority is needed to preserve social cohesion; this places it firmly in the pro‑authority quadrant, though not at the extreme end.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Cameroon routinely invokes emergency powers and enforces strict restrictions on assembly, expression, and internet access—especially during security crises such as the Boko Hamra insurgency and the COVID‑19 pandemic—demonstrating a willingness to curtail personal freedoms contrary to the statement.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Cameroon mandates conscription for male citizens aged 18‑25, but does not extend this requirement to women, so it partially supports the statement relative to many countries that have abolished or limited conscription.",0.33
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Cameroon’s governance remains dominated by President Paul Biya’s long‑standing rule, with weak judicial independence, restricted press, and limited civil‑society oversight, resulting in minimal public scrutiny and accountability mechanisms. Compared to global standards where leaders face robust transparency and public checks, Cameroon is markedly anti‑accountability, reflecting an authoritarian orientation.",-0.75
