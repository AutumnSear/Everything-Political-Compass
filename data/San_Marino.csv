Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"San Marino enforces a comprehensive set of regulations to protect workers, consumers, and the environment, yet its economy remains largely market‑driven; therefore it supports regulation to curb exploitation but does not pursue an extreme, heavy‑handed approach.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"San Marino operates a mixed tax regime with progressive personal income taxes and a welfare system that provides universal healthcare and pension contributions, reflecting a moderate commitment to redistribution; however, its notably low corporate tax and limited social spending relative to larger welfare states keep it closer to the political centre.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"San Marino’s constitutional and economic framework promotes private enterprise—low corporate taxes, limited regulation, and a tax regime designed to attract foreign investors—while still providing extensive public services (healthcare, education, welfare).

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"San Marino upholds a robust legal framework and maintains law‑and‑order institutions, yet its constitution and democratic traditions strongly protect individual liberties, rarely allowing broad restrictions on freedoms. Consequently, its practical stance aligns modestly with prioritizing law and order while still remaining largely balanced.",0.1
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"San Marino’s constitution establishes a parliamentary system with a Grand and General Council and two Captains‑Regent elected every six months, ensuring no single individual holds prolonged power; its democratic record reflects a commitment to shared governance rather than a “strong leader” model.

This places San Marino moderately above the centrist point but not at the extreme “never sacrifice freedom” position.",0.3
