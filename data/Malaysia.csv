Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Malaysia maintains a moderate regulatory framework—having robust oversight in strategic sectors (oil, mining, telecommunications) and consumer/labour protections, yet it simultaneously promotes free‑market reforms, foreign investment, and regulatory streamlining, placing it slightly to the left of the neutral axis.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Malaysia maintains a progressive income‑tax system and social‑assistance schemes, but its overall tax‑to‑GDP ratio and welfare‑state scope are below the OECD average, indicating a moderate but not strongly left‑leaning commitment to redistribution.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Malaysia operates a mixed‑market economy with significant state ownership in strategic sectors, yet it has pursued privatization, regulatory simplification, and a strong emphasis on private enterprise as drivers of growth; this indicates a moderate agreement that private businesses are often more efficient than government programs.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Malaysia legally recognizes trade unions under the Trade Union Act and views them as a tool for protecting workers’ rights, yet imposes strict registration and oversight that keep union density low and enforcement moderate—placing the country in a mildly pro‑union stance relative to global norms.",0.25

Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Malaysia operates a moderate welfare framework that combines universal benefits with work‑conditioned assistance (e.g., EPF, SOCSO, targeted family subsidies), reflecting a policy stance that largely discourages the view that welfare programs inherently discourage individual responsibility.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Malaysia operates a mixed healthcare system, providing publicly funded services while allowing substantial private sector participation and health‑insurance companies; the government subsidizes but does not mandate the elimination of private insurers.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Malaysia’s personal income tax is progressive, with the highest marginal rate at 30 % and the system including various deductions, but it lacks wealth or inheritance taxes and offers corporate incentives that keep overall rates moderate. Compared with global norms, this reflects a moderate agreement with the idea that the rich should pay higher rates than the poor.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Malaysia maintains a moderate pro‑business stance: a 24 % corporate tax, a streamlined Companies Act, and a generally business‑friendly regulatory framework, yet it still imposes notable restrictions on foreign ownership in key sectors and affirmative‑action policies that limit unrestricted corporate growth.",0.35

Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Malaysia’s legal framework—most notably the Communications and Multimedia Act, the Digital Security Act, and the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act—explicitly grants the government broad powers to monitor communications and other activities in the name of national security.

Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Malaysia enforces laws that penalize unauthorized civil disobedience, and the government has historically suppressed non‑violent protests, indicating a negative stance on civil disobedience as a legitimate protest.
