Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Malta enforces significant consumer, labor, and environmental regulations to align with EU standards, yet it maintains a low-tax, pro‑business climate that limits over‑regulation, reflecting a moderate pro‑regulation position rather than an extreme stance.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Malta implements a progressive personal income tax (up to 35%) and offers universal healthcare, a public pension scheme, and unemployment benefits, reflecting moderate wealth‑redistribution policies typical of many EU member states. Though its overall social‑spending ratio is lower than some high‑spending European countries, the combination of progressive taxation and welfare provisions places Malta on the centrist‑pro side of the redistribution spectrum.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Malta operates a mixed economy with a robust private sector supported by low corporate taxes and a business‑friendly regulatory regime, while still sustaining a sizable public sector that delivers welfare and public services. Compared to other EU states, Malta’s policy mix leans slightly toward the private side, reflecting a modest preference for private efficiency over government programs.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Malta enforces comprehensive labor protections, mandates collective bargaining, and maintains a high union density, positioning it firmly in favor of unions as essential safeguards for workers’ rights.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Malta runs a largely liberalized economy with low corporate taxes and open trade, yet it also upholds strong welfare programs, high taxation, and EU‑mandated regulations, reflecting a mixed‑market stance rather than a pure laissez‑faire approach.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Malta operates a broad welfare state with universal health care, free education, generous pension and unemployment benefits, and a tradition of social security support that signals a strong commitment to state‑provided welfare, thereby strongly disagreeing with the claim that such programs discourage individual responsibility.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Malta offers universal public healthcare funded by taxation, while private insurers mainly provide optional supplementary coverage; thus Malta leans modestly toward replacing private insurance with public health but still retains a private sector.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Malta applies a progressive personal‑income tax with a top marginal rate of 48% and additional solidarity levies, reflecting a clear preference for higher taxes on the wealthy—similar to many EU members.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Malta offers a relatively low nominal corporate tax (35 %) with generous incentive schemes that reduce effective rates, signaling a business‑friendly environment; however, it remains bound to EU competition, AML, data protection, and labour regulations, which impose meaningful restrictions. Compared to global norms, Malta is moderately pro‑corporate but not “minimal‑restriction” territory.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Malta retains state ownership of its core utilities (electricity, water, gas) and only introduced limited market competition in the electricity sector in 2006; the water sector remains fully public. Compared to global norms, Malta therefore leans toward public ownership of essential services.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Malta operates a mixed‑market economy with strong welfare provisions and relatively low income inequality, yet it relies on capitalist mechanisms for growth and innovation. Therefore, Malta would likely disagree with the claim that capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability, placing it modestly to the pro‑capitalism side of the scale.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Malta operates a mixed‑market economy with a strong pro‑business agenda—low corporate tax, incentives for R&D, and membership in the EU single market—yet it also maintains substantial state‑owned enterprises and a welfare system, keeping it on the right of center but not fully laissez‑faire.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Malta permits surveillance when justified by national security, but it requires judicial oversight and adherence to strict data‑protection standards under EU law, reflecting a moderate, balanced approach.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Malta’s constitution and EU commitments provide robust protection for freedom of expression, and its high press‑freedom ranking shows that criticism of government is generally tolerated.  Occasional defamation and sedition provisions exist, but they are limited and not routinely used to silence dissent, placing Malta above the global centre on this issue.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Malta enforces strict drug and anti‑terrorism laws and has expanded surveillance powers, indicating a moderate emphasis on law and order, yet it remains committed to EU human‑rights standards, placing it slightly to the right of the center on the universal scale.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Malta operates as a parliamentary democracy with robust institutions, EU membership, and a history of peaceful power transitions, indicating a clear preference for democratic governance over a “strong leader” model.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Malta’s political system is predominantly representative, with a parliamentary proportional‑representation model and very few referendums in its history (e.g., 1998 constitutional, 2003 EU accession). The limited use of direct democracy and a strong party‑based culture place Malta slightly against the idea that most issues should be decided by referendums.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Malta has enacted recent reforms that broaden police powers—such as expanded surveillance, use‑of‑force regulations, and anti‑crime operations—while preserving robust oversight mechanisms, positioning it moderately in favor of enhanced police authority compared to global standards.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Malta’s constitution and the 2015 Human Rights Act protect freedom of assembly and expression, and the state has generally tolerated peaceful protest, indicating a degree of openness to civil disobedience.

Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Malta’s welfare‑state policies—free public health, education, and robust social support—demonstrate a moderate reliance on government authority to promote social cohesion, aligning with typical European mixed‑market norms rather than extreme state control.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Malta’s constitution and high Freedom House ranking show a strong commitment to civil liberties, yet its legal framework allows limited emergency restrictions, indicating a moderate alignment with the statement.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Malta does not have a compulsory military service; its Armed Forces are volunteer‑based, matching the stance of most EU member states that reject conscription. Therefore Malta would strongly disagree with mandatory service.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Malta possesses formal legal and institutional mechanisms—such as an Anti‑Corruption Commission, a judiciary that can prosecute misconduct, and a competitive election system—that promote public accountability of leaders. However, practical enforcement gaps, media‑freedom concerns, and occasional corruption scandals temper the strength of this stance compared with higher‑ranked democracies.",0.4
