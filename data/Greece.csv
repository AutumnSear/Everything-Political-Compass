Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Greece, as an EU member, implements comprehensive regulatory frameworks in finance, labor, consumer protection, and environmental standards, aligning it with a pro‑regulation stance, though it has also pursued market‑friendly reforms during its recent crisis.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Greece’s tax system and social welfare provisions are markedly progressive compared with many global peers, and the country has historically relied on taxation to fund redistributive programs—though austerity measures in the 2010s temporarily weakened that effect.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,Greece has implemented reforms that favor private-sector efficiency—such as privatization of state enterprises and deregulation—yet it still sustains a substantial public welfare system; thus its position is moderately pro‑private but not fully in favor.,0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Greece’s labor law framework, high union density (~36 % of workers), and institutionalized social‑dialogue mechanism—where unions participate in collective bargaining and policy consultations—demonstrate a strong practical commitment to unions as essential safeguards for workers’ rights.",0.78
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Greece’s recent economic reforms (e.g., austerity measures, privatizations, and liberalization of certain sectors) signal a pragmatic support for market mechanisms, yet the state continues to regulate key industries, maintain substantial welfare provisions, and often intervene to safeguard public interests, reflecting a cautious rather than laissez‑faire stance.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Greece maintains a universal welfare system (pensions, health care, family allowances) yet has repeatedly enacted austerity measures that cut benefits, reflecting a moderate stance that does not strongly endorse the view that welfare discourages responsibility.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Greece already operates a universal public healthcare system (ESY) that provides baseline coverage, yet private insurance and private hospitals remain integral for supplementary services, indicating a pragmatic, mixed‑market approach rather than a full public takeover. This places Greece modestly toward supporting public healthcare but not fully endorsing the replacement of private insurers.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Greece’s tax system is strongly progressive, with top marginal personal income tax rates at about 45 % and a high overall tax‑to‑GDP ratio, indicating a policy stance that the wealthy should pay more; this aligns with the statement.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Greece’s regulatory framework—characterized by significant social‑welfare obligations, labor protections, EU competition rules, and a relatively high corporate tax—places it modestly to the left of a minimal‑restriction stance; while it preserves private enterprise, the overall environment is not fully conducive to unrestricted corporate growth.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Greece’s Constitution and current law still keep key utilities (electricity, water, rail) under public ownership, though the government has made limited privatization moves, placing the country moderately on the pro‑public utilities side.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Greece’s mixed‑market economy, coupled with the 2009–2018 austerity crisis, has demonstrated how capitalist structures can exacerbate inequality and social instability, yet the country still operates within a broadly capitalist framework with EU‑supported market reforms. This suggests a moderate inclination toward agreeing with the statement.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Greece’s economy is a typical EU mixed‑market model, with significant state ownership, heavy regulation, and a welfare state that emphasizes public planning.

Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Greece legally permits surveillance for national‑security purposes through laws such as the 2005 National Security Law and the 2015 data‑monitoring legislation, yet it operates under strict EU data‑protection obligations that limit the scope and oversight of such measures. Compared to global norms, Greece’s stance is moderately pro‑surveillance, but tempered by regulatory checks, placing it on the lower‑mid positive end of the spectrum.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Greece guarantees freedom of expression in its constitution and enjoys a relatively free press, yet criminal defamation statutes and sporadic anti‑terror and security measures occasionally curtail unfettered criticism, placing it moderately supportive of the statement.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Greece’s democratic constitution and EU membership strongly protect civil liberties, but the state has repeatedly invoked emergency and anti‑terrorism legislation that temporarily limits freedoms for law‑and‑order reasons, positioning it modestly on the pro‑law‑and‑order side of the global spectrum.",0.15

Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Greece’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and its democratic history—especially the large‑scale civil‑disobedience protests of 2013–2015—shows the state tolerates non‑violent protest. This aligns with global norms that view civil disobedience as a legitimate, if not fully endorsed, form of protest.",0.5

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Greece’s constitution and EU obligations uphold personal freedoms, yet during the refugee influx (2015‑2016) and the COVID‑19 pandemic it enacted temporary restrictions on movement, assembly and press, indicating a moderate willingness to suspend liberties in crises.",0.3
