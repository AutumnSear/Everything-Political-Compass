Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Ireland combines a liberal, low‑tax business environment with comprehensive EU‑aligned regulations on labor, consumer protection, environmental standards, and competition. This balance yields a moderately pro‑regulation stance, but not “heavy” in the extreme sense.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Ireland uses a progressive tax structure and runs a broad welfare state that reduces inequality, but its overall tax‑to‑GDP ratio and social spending are moderate relative to more heavily redistributive European nations, positioning it on the left side of the compass.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Ireland’s low corporate tax regime, robust support for private enterprise, and high ranking in global ease‑of‑doing‑business indexes indicate a moderate endorsement that private businesses are often more efficient, while its substantial public welfare and education systems show an acknowledgment that government programs also play crucial roles; overall, Ireland leans slightly pro‑private.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Ireland’s legal framework strongly protects collective bargaining—evidenced by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act 2006, workers’ rights statutes, and high union density (~30% of workforce)—placing it well above the typical moderate pro‑union stance seen in many OECD economies.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Ireland champions free‑market principles—evidenced by its low corporate tax rate, extensive free‑trade agreements, and active participation in the EU single market—yet it also sustains a robust welfare state, public sector services, and regulatory oversight, positioning it as a moderately pro‑market actor relative to global norms.",0.45

Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Ireland operates a largely public healthcare system (HSE) that provides universal coverage, but it also permits and actively uses private health insurance and private hospitals; thus the country only partially supports the replacement of private insurance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Ireland employs a progressive personal tax system—20 % for lower incomes and 40 % for higher incomes—alongside substantial social benefits, showing moderate support for taxing the rich more heavily than the poor. Its low corporate tax rate balances this progressive stance, keeping it closer to the center of the global spectrum.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Ireland’s low corporate tax regime and pro‑investment stance reflect a pro‑corporate bias, yet its EU membership and domestic welfare framework impose significant regulatory, environmental, and competition restrictions—placing it moderately to the right of the center.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Ireland keeps most essential utilities (water, electricity transmission, public health, and education) under public ownership and regulation, while only parts of generation and retail are market‑led; this places it firmly in favor of public provision relative to global practice.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Ireland acknowledges that capitalism can produce inequality and market instability, yet its mixed‑economy model—characterised by a robust welfare state, progressive taxation, and EU‑driven regulatory oversight—aims to mitigate these effects.

Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Ireland actively promotes private R&D through generous tax incentives and a supportive startup ecosystem, yet maintains substantial state involvement in key services such as healthcare and infrastructure, placing it slightly to the right of the global average for profit‑driven innovation.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Ireland permits targeted surveillance for national‑security purposes within a framework of legal oversight (Security Intelligence Act 2014, Data Protection Acts, GDPR compliance), so it leans slightly pro‑surveillance but stops far short of unrestricted constant monitoring.",0.2

Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Ireland operates a stable parliamentary democracy with robust checks and balances, consistently upholds rule‑of‑law principles, and its policy record shows support for democratic participation rather than a single strong leader; thus it rejects the notion that authoritarian leadership is preferable.",-0.6
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Ireland routinely employs referendums for constitutional amendments and major social reforms—more frequently than most democracies—but it does not use direct vote for ordinary legislation, so its practice is moderately pro‑direct democracy but falls short of the statement’s “most issues” claim.",0.25
