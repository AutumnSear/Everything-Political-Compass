While the heavy regulation is more about maintaining state control and revenue than protecting workers, the country’s policy profile aligns strongly with the idea of a government imposing significant regulatory oversight over industries.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Turkmenistan’s tax regime is largely flat and modest (e.g., 10 % corporate tax, 7 % personal income tax) and its primary redistribution mechanisms rely on state subsidies and public service provision funded by oil revenues rather than progressive taxation. Consequently, the country does not regard wealth redistribution through taxation as an essential tool for reducing inequality.",-0.25

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Turkmenistan applies a flat 10 % personal income tax with no progressive brackets, and its revenue largely stems from state‑owned natural‑resource enterprises rather than higher rates on the wealthy; thus it would strongly oppose the notion that the rich should pay significantly higher taxes.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Turkmenistan’s economy remains heavily state‑controlled, with extensive regulation, nationalized key sectors, and limited private enterprise freedom—far from a minimal‑restriction model.

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Turkmenistan’s political system is dominated by a single, strong executive that exercises extensive censorship, suppresses opposition, and enshrines the ability to suspend civil liberties in the name of security; its constitutional and legal framework reflects a clear prioritization of law and order over individual freedoms, aligning closely with an authoritarian stance on this issue.",0.95

Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Turkmenistan’s political system is highly centralized and authoritarian, with limited press freedom, a controlled judiciary, and no independent mechanisms for public oversight of leaders; therefore it falls far below global norms that support strict accountability.",-0.85
