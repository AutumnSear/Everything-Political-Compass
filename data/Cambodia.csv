Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Cambodia’s industrial policy is largely market‑oriented, with minimal enforcement of labor and environmental regulations; this reflects a preference against heavy governmental oversight.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Cambodia’s tax-to-GDP ratio is one of the lowest in the region (≈ 2–3 % of GDP), and its social‑transfer programs are modest and largely targeted, reflecting a policy emphasis on state‑led growth rather than comprehensive redistribution. This places it below centrist levels on the universal political compass.",-0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Cambodia’s economic policy is heavily oriented toward liberalization and attracting private investment, while the state still retains control over strategic sectors; the government’s consistent promotion of private enterprise and limited support for large-scale public programs indicates a pragmatic, pro‑private stance relative to global norms.",0.7

Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Cambodia operates a mixed economy with significant state intervention, widespread regulation, and limited property rights, reflecting a preference for government‑led development over laissez‑faire markets.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Cambodia operates a limited welfare system focused on basic health coverage and modest social security, yet it has not articulated a strong ideological stance that welfare discourages responsibility; thus its position aligns neutrally with the statement.",0.0

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Cambodia maintains a flat corporate tax rate of 20 % and a low personal income tax ceiling of 1 % for wages below $1,200, with no progressive brackets or wealth taxes; the country’s tax-to-GDP ratio hovers around 7 %, indicating a weak fiscal stance toward the wealthy. This diverges from the statement’s advocacy for significantly higher rates on the rich.",-0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Cambodia has opened many sectors to foreign investment and offers incentives, yet its legal framework still imposes significant regulatory, land‑ownership, and corruption‑related constraints that limit the extent of minimal corporate restrictions relative to more liberal economies.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Cambodia keeps core utilities (electricity, water, and some telecom) under state ownership, but has introduced private participation through concessions and joint ventures, placing it in a moderate pro‑public stance relative to global mixed‑market norms.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Cambodia actively pursues market‑oriented reforms and foreign investment, viewing capitalism as a key engine for growth, while attributing inequality mainly to uneven development rather than to capitalism itself; thus it would largely reject the statement.",-0.25

Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Cambodia enforces broad surveillance powers under its ICT and counter‑terrorism laws, routinely monitors political dissent, and lacks robust independent oversight, making it more permissive of state monitoring than most democracies. Compared with global norms, its stance is strongly pro‑surveillance for national security.",0.78
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Cambodia’s legal framework, media regulations, and recent enforcement actions severely limit citizens’ ability to criticize the government without fear of legal or administrative retaliation, placing it well below global norms for free expression.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Cambodia’s long‑standing authoritarian governance routinely curtails civil liberties in the name of national security and social stability, aligning closely with the emphasis on prioritizing law and order over individual freedoms.",0.88
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Cambodia’s political system is dominated by Hun Sen’s long‑term rule, with systematic suppression of opposition, controlled elections, and limited media freedom, reflecting a preference for centralized authority over pluralistic governance. Compared to global norms where mixed‑market democracies prevail, Cambodia aligns strongly with the idea that a single, decisive leader is preferable to a fragmented democracy.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Cambodia’s political system is dominated by the Cambodian People's Party and its constitution delegates major decision‑making to a unicameral parliament; referendums are rarely, if ever, used, indicating a strong preference for representative rather than direct democracy.",-0.9

Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Cambodia’s constitution and law criminalize unsanctioned public protest, and the regime routinely arrests, detains, or silences dissenting activists, leaving civil disobedience virtually unprotected and widely suppressed. Compared with global norms that generally tolerate or even endorse civil disobedience as a democratic tool, Cambodia’s stance is strongly opposed.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Cambodia’s authoritarian regime strongly endorses centralized authority as essential for social stability, reflected in restrictive laws, suppression of dissent, and a governance model that prioritizes state control over individual freedoms; compared to the more moderate stance of democratic governments worldwide, Cambodia scores high on this dimension.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Cambodia’s record shows systematic restrictions on press, political opposition, and civil society, and its constitution permits broad state‑security exemptions, placing it firmly on the restrictive side of the freedom spectrum.",-0.65
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Cambodia’s law mandates compulsory military service for eligible male citizens, aligning it with countries that practice conscription, though enforcement is moderate rather than universal.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Cambodia operates under an authoritarian regime with limited judicial independence and suppressed political dissent, which severely curtails public accountability of its leaders. Compared to global norms where democratic institutions ensure checks and balances, Cambodia’s system falls far short of enforcing strict accountability by the public.",-0.9
