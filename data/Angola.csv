Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Angola maintains a significant state presence in key sectors such as oil, diamonds, and mining, with regulatory frameworks designed to curb exploitation; however, enforcement and transparency remain limited, placing its approach between moderate state intervention and market openness.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Angola’s tax system is largely flat, its public welfare spending remains below regional averages, and its Gini coefficient hovers around 49—indicating limited redistributive effort relative to many global peers. Consequently, Angola’s practical stance on the necessity of wealth‑redistribution through taxation sits just to the right of the center, reflecting a modestly negative position on the universal political compass.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Angola’s constitution protects private property and the government has pursued selective privatization and foreign‑investment incentives, suggesting a recognition that private firms can be efficient, yet the state still dominates strategic sectors, leaving Angola just slightly right‑leaning on this issue.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Angola’s constitution and labor statutes formally recognize the right to unionise and the labour ministry promotes union activity, yet unions operate under strong state oversight and union density remains low, indicating a modest but not wholehearted endorsement of unions as essential for protecting workers.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Angola has historically maintained a heavily state‑controlled economy with significant public ownership of key sectors, but in recent years it has introduced market‑oriented reforms and reduced subsidies, reflecting a cautious rather than fully free‑market approach. This suggests a moderate to mildly negative alignment with the idea that completely unregulated markets benefit everyone in the long run.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Angola maintains a state‑run welfare system rooted in its socialist history yet has gradually embraced market reforms; the government still provides social security and assistance, indicating a moderate left stance that slightly disagrees with the view that welfare discourages responsibility.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Angola operates a public health system that is underfunded but still primary, while private insurance plays a minimal role; the government tends to favor expanding public coverage but is unlikely to fully eliminate private providers.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Angola has a nominally progressive personal income tax (up to 33 % for high earners) and higher corporate rates for oil/mining, but weak enforcement and a low tax‑to‑GDP ratio mean the rich are not heavily taxed in practice, placing Angola only modestly on the pro‑progressive side.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Angola maintains strong state control over key sectors (oil, mining, banking) and imposes significant regulatory burdens on corporations, reflecting a restrictive stance compared to global liberal norms.",-0.6
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Angola’s major utilities—electricity, water, oil and gas—are largely managed by state‑owned enterprises (e.g., EMEL, Sonangol, Angola Telecom), with only limited privatization, placing it above global centrist norms toward public ownership. The MPLA‑led government has pursued minimal concessions, aligning it positively with the statement.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Angola’s economic system is dominated by state control of key sectors and strong government intervention, yet it remains heavily reliant on oil‑driven market mechanisms; the country experiences significant inequality and occasional instability, but it does not advocate for the abolition of capitalism, indicating a modest leftward inclination.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Angola’s economic policy remains heavily state‑controlled, with the government owning key sectors (oil, mining, infrastructure) and directing development plans; private profit‑driven innovation is limited and seen as less central to national progress than state‑led planning, contrasting with more market‑oriented global norms.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Angola’s constitution and national security legislation grant broad powers to law‑enforcement and intelligence agencies to monitor communications and activities, especially under the threat of terrorism or civil unrest.  Historical evidence of internet censorship, surveillance of opposition figures, and limited judicial oversight indicate a policy stance that leans toward accepting state monitoring for security purposes, though it stops short of universal, constant surveillance.",0.65
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Angola’s constitution formally guarantees freedom of expression, but in practice the state frequently criminalizes dissent, arrests journalists, and imposes restrictive media laws—reflecting a strong inclination to limit criticism. This pattern places Angola near the extreme end of the spectrum, opposing open criticism.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Angola operates as an authoritarian, single‑party state where the MPLA tightly controls political expression, press, and assembly; the government routinely invokes security and anti‑terrorism laws to justify restrictions on civil liberties, a pattern reflected in its “Not Free” Freedom House score and low rule‑of‑law rankings. Compared with global norms, Angola leans strongly toward prioritizing law and order even at the expense of personal freedoms.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Angola’s governance has long centered on a dominant party and a highly centralized presidential system, with limited institutional checks and frequent reports of electoral irregularities—reflecting a preference for strong leadership over a fragmented, “messy” democracy. Compared with global norms, this aligns the country toward the authoritarian end of the spectrum.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Angola’s political system is dominated by the MPLA with a highly centralized executive; referendums are rare and have only been used on limited constitutional matters, indicating a general resistance to widespread direct citizen decision‑making.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Angola’s political system is authoritarian, with a strong security apparatus that has historically been granted extensive powers to maintain public order; the government’s approach to policing tends to prioritize state control over civil liberties, placing it well above the global average in support of expanded police authority.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Angola’s political system is effectively a single‑party state with significant restrictions on free expression and assembly; civil disobedience is rarely protected by law and is routinely met with repression, indicating a strong disagreement with the statement.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Angola’s post‑civil‑war governance emphasizes a strong central state, laws on national unity, and limited political pluralism, indicating a view that robust government authority is key to social cohesion—higher than most democracies but less than a fully totalitarian regime.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Angola’s governance is highly centralized and has repeatedly curtailed civil liberties in the name of security, diverging sharply from global liberal norms that emphasize preserving personal freedoms even in crises.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Angola’s constitution and defence policy require national service for male citizens, but it is not compulsory for women and is often waived for those in education or lacking resources; thus Angola aligns moderately with the statement.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Angola’s constitution and anti‑corruption laws nominally call for public accountability, but in practice the judiciary is weak, press freedom is limited, and high corruption ratings show that leaders enjoy substantial protection from scrutiny. Compared to global norms, Angola leans towards lower public accountability for leaders.",-0.45
