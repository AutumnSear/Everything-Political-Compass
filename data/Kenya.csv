Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Kenya maintains a mixed‑market economy with robust regulatory bodies for labour, competition, and key sectors such as mining and telecommunications, yet it simultaneously encourages foreign investment and free‑trade policies, positioning it modestly left of centre.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Kenya implements a moderately progressive tax system and operates a range of social‑welfare programs (free primary education, national health insurance, old‑age pensions, and child support grants) that redistribute income to some degree. Compared to many low‑ and middle‑income countries, these policies are more redistributive, but Kenya’s overall fiscal policy remains market‑oriented and its tax rates are lower than those of typical welfare states, placing it on the pro‑redistribution side of the scale, though not at the extreme.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Kenya has pursued significant market‑oriented reforms and privatization of many state enterprises, signaling a preference for private-sector efficiency, yet it maintains substantial government programs in health, education, and rural development, reflecting a moderate, mixed‑market stance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Kenya’s constitution guarantees freedom of association and the 2012 Labour Act explicitly protects union rights and collective bargaining, resulting in a robust and politically active union movement that frequently shapes labour policy. This legal and practical support places Kenya moderately on the pro‑union side of the universal political compass, aligning with a centrist‑pro stance.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,Kenya has adopted liberalization policies yet maintains significant state involvement in key sectors; persistent inequality and regulatory constraints indicate that unregulated markets alone do not universally benefit all citizens.,-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Kenya runs a mixed welfare system—social safety nets like the National Social Safety Net Programme coexist with policies encouraging education, skills training, and entrepreneurship—indicating a moderate disagreement with the notion that welfare programs broadly discourage individual responsibility.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Kenya has broadened its public National Hospital Insurance Fund and enshrines universal health coverage in its constitution, signalling support for public healthcare, but it still maintains a substantial private insurance sector and does not aim to eliminate it entirely.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Kenya employs a progressive personal‑income tax with a top marginal rate of 37 % and no wealth tax, indicating a modest preference for higher taxes on the wealthy compared with the poor, but not an aggressive progressive stance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Kenya actively promotes investment via the Investment Act and special economic zones, yet it retains considerable regulatory oversight—competition law, labor standards, environmental mandates, and corporate governance requirements—indicating a moderate, not fully minimal, restriction stance.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Kenya maintains state ownership of key utilities—electricity (Kenya Power & Lighting Company) and water (Water Resources Authority)—while allowing limited private participation through concessions and PPPs, showing a moderate pro‑public stance.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Kenya has embraced market‑oriented reforms and a private‑sector driven economy, yet it suffers high inequality (Gini ≈ 43) and significant social instability, prompting substantial state intervention in education, health, and social security. These facts indicate a cautious, slightly critical view of capitalism rather than an unequivocal endorsement.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Kenya operates a mixed-market economy that actively promotes private innovation—through incentives for tech startups, fintech hubs, and agricultural R&D—while still maintaining significant state planning via Vision 2030 and state-owned enterprises; thus it leans modestly toward profit-driven innovation rather than pure state planning.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Kenya’s 2010 Constitution permits limited surveillance for national security and the government has enacted laws such as the Anti‑Terrorism Act and the Communications (Monitoring, Interception and Decryption) Act to operationalise this, yet significant constitutional safeguards and public debate constrain an extreme pro‑surveillance stance.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Kenya’s 2010 Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, but the country still enforces criminal defamation statutes, restrictive media regulations, and has a history of detaining or intimidating critics, yielding a moderate level of permissible dissent with real consequences.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Kenya’s 2010 constitution protects rights but also grants broad powers for security, and its anti‑terrorism and emergency laws frequently curtail civil liberties, placing it modestly pro‑law‑and‑order relative to many democracies.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Kenya’s 2010 constitution enshrines democratic institutions and checks on executive power, and despite periodic election disputes and occasional authoritarian tendencies, its legal and institutional framework aligns more closely with global democratic norms than with an authoritarian preference.",-0.15
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Kenya’s constitution permits referendums on constitutional amendments, but the country rarely uses direct popular votes for most policy decisions, relying instead on representative elections and parliamentary debate; this places Kenya slightly below the global norm for direct‑democracy advocates.",-0.15
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Kenya’s 2015 Police Service Act and subsequent reforms have granted the police greater independence and expanded authority, yet the government also imposes oversight mechanisms and public scrutiny, reflecting a moderate pro‑police stance relative to global norms.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Kenya’s 2010 Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and expression, which legally endorses civil disobedience as a protected form of protest, yet its Public Order Act and related statutes criminalise disruptive or violent conduct, leading the state to sometimes suppress demonstrators; this mixed legal and practical stance places Kenya modestly on the pro‑civil disobedience side of the scale.",0.25

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Kenya’s constitution enshrines personal freedoms but explicitly permits limited suspensions during emergencies; the country’s history of detentions, media restrictions and the Anti‑Terrorism Act demonstrate a willingness to curtail liberties in crisis situations, placing it modestly below neutral on this axis.",-0.1
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Kenya requires all citizens to undergo a 10‑day National Service program, which promotes civic and basic military training but does not impose full conscription into the armed forces, placing the country modestly in favor of mandatory service relative to global norms.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Kenya’s 2010 Constitution, anti‑corruption laws, and active civil society create formal mechanisms for public accountability, yet enforcement gaps and political patronage limit strictness; thus Kenya leans moderately pro‑accountability compared to global norms.",0.35
