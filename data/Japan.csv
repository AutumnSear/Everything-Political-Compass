Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Japan’s economy is a highly mixed system with strong government involvement in industrial policy and subsidies, yet it also maintains a robust private sector and high regulatory quality.

Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Japan’s utilities sector is largely privatized—electricity, rail, and water services are dominated by private firms, and even public utilities are regulated rather than wholly owned—so the country aligns with a pro‑privatization stance, which is the global norm for advanced economies.",-0.5

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Japan upholds a strong rule‑of‑law framework and generally protects civil liberties, but it does impose certain public‑order restrictions (e.g., police authority over assemblies) that reflect a moderate willingness to limit freedoms for perceived safety.",0.2

Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Japan’s constitutional democracy and parliamentary oversight create mechanisms for holding leaders accountable, yet the cultural emphasis on party unity and the tendency for resignations over outright removal give it a moderate, slightly pro‑accountability stance compared with global norms.",0.3
