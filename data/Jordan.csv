Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Jordan enforces basic labor and consumer protections but largely encourages free‑market reforms and privatization; its regulatory regime is moderate and less heavy than many welfare‑state economies, thus the country leans slightly to the right on this issue.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Jordan implements a moderate progressive tax regime (personal income up to 30%, corporate 20%, VAT 16%) and runs social‑security, subsidized healthcare, and cash‑transfer programs that redistribute income, but its overall tax revenue is low (≈10 % of GDP) and the welfare system is less expansive than in many OECD countries. This places it on the pro‑redistribution side, yet not at the extreme end of the spectrum.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Jordan has pursued a series of privatization and liberalization reforms (e.g., telecom, electricity, water) indicating a pro‑private‑business stance, yet the public sector remains sizable (health, education, subsidies). Compared to global mixed‑market economies, Jordan is moderately pro‑privatization but still retains substantial state involvement.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Jordan’s constitution and labour law grant workers the right to unionise and bargain collectively, but practical restrictions, low union density, and government influence temper this support, placing Jordan moderately in favour of unions as a means to protect workers’ rights.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Jordan has implemented a range of market‑liberalization reforms—such as deregulation, privatization of state enterprises, and participation in the WTO—yet it also maintains significant subsidies, strategic sector control, and a relatively high regulatory burden. These mixed‑market practices suggest a moderate, not fully laissez‑faire, stance, placing Jordan slightly above pure centrism on the free‑market scale.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Jordan maintains a moderate welfare system (universal health, free education, social assistance) while promoting employment and family planning, indicating it views welfare more as a safety net than a deterrent to responsibility.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Jordan operates a mixed health system where public hospitals coexist with a sizeable private insurance sector; it has not pursued a transition to a fully public healthcare model, indicating moderate support for public replacement of private insurance.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Jordan’s personal income tax is progressive, with marginal rates up to 20 % and a VAT of 16 %, but overall tax rates and revenue are relatively low compared with OECD peers, indicating a moderate endorsement of higher rates for the wealthy.",0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Jordan has pursued liberal economic reforms, free‑trade agreements, and initiatives to cut red tape, yet it retains state control over key sectors and maintains regulatory oversight, positioning it moderately pro‑business but not fully laissez‑faire.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Jordan keeps majority ownership of key utilities such as electricity, water, and telecommunications, while gradually opening these sectors to private participation through concessions and partial sales. This mixed‑market approach places Jordan slightly on the pro‑public side of the spectrum, though not fully public.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Jordan operates a mixed‑market economy with significant state subsidies and public sector employment, yet it pursues liberal reforms and foreign investment, placing it near the center of the political compass. It acknowledges some inequality linked to capitalism but does not view it as inevitable or wholly destructive.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Jordan pursues a mixed economy with significant state planning and subsidies while encouraging private sector growth, positioning it slightly toward state planning rather than profit-driven innovation compared to market‑oriented nations.",-0.15
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Jordan’s legal framework and security policies allow and actively use surveillance for counterterrorism and national security, showing a clear endorsement of the statement, though not to an extreme extent.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Jordan’s constitution and penal code criminalize criticism of the king, the monarchy and certain government officials, with penalties ranging from fines to prison; thus, the country falls well below global norms for free political expression.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Jordan’s constitutional and security framework—highlighted by broad anti‑terrorism and press‑control laws, restrictions on political parties, and a history of limiting civil liberties for public order—demonstrates a clear preference for prioritizing law and order over personal freedoms, positioning it moderately to the right of the global average.",0.42
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Jordan’s political system is a constitutional monarchy in which the king holds broad executive and legislative powers while democratic institutions are constrained by limited opposition space and restrictive laws, indicating a pragmatic preference for strong centralized authority over a more chaotic democracy. This aligns moderately with the statement.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Jordan’s political system is a constitutional monarchy that relies on representative elections and royal decrees rather than widespread referendums, reflecting a moderate stance against direct public decision‑making.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Jordan’s security‑centric governance and laws—such as the 2007 Police Force Law and the 2015 Counter‑Terrorism Law—grant police broad arrest, detention, and operational powers, reflecting a pro‑police stance relative to global norms. While the country is not at the extreme end of authoritarian policing, its emphasis on police authority to control crime places it modestly to the right of the compass.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Jordan’s constitution nominally protects the right to assembly, but its legal framework—particularly laws restricting “public demonstrations that threaten public order”—and its history of detaining protesters (e.g., 2019‑2020 protests) demonstrate a moderate anti‑civil‑disobedience stance typical of many Middle Eastern monarchies.",-0.6

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Jordan’s constitution and emergency laws routinely permit the suspension of personal freedoms for security reasons, and its low Freedom House ranking, restrictive press regulations, and limited democratic participation indicate a willingness to sacrifice those freedoms in crises, placing it below neutrality.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Jordan mandates compulsory military service for all male citizens, a common practice in many states, but does not extend this requirement to women, so its policy only partially aligns with the statement that service should be mandatory for all citizens.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Jordan’s constitutional monarchy concentrates executive power in the king, limiting direct public accountability—especially for the head of state—while elections, an anti‑corruption commission, and a semi‑open media provide some checks that are weaker than in many democracies. Consequently, Jordan falls slightly below global norms for strict public accountability.",-0.25
