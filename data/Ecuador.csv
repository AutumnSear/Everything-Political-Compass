Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Ecuador has a history of state regulation in key sectors—especially oil, mining, and agriculture—alongside robust social‑welfare laws that aim to curb exploitation, yet its market‑oriented reforms and openness to foreign investment keep the overall regulatory stance moderate rather than extreme.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Ecuador has a progressive tax regime and a modest social‑welfare system aimed at reducing inequality, but its tax rates and social‑spending levels are lower than those of most OECD welfare states, placing it in a moderately center‑left position.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Ecuador’s economy is predominantly private‑sector driven (≈70 % of GDP), and it has implemented market reforms and privatizations that suggest a belief in private efficiency. However, the state retains significant control over key industries (oil, sugar, telecommunications) and historically has used nationalization and subsidies to support public welfare, reflecting a more left‑leaning stance than many Western markets.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Ecuador’s constitution and labor code explicitly protect union rights and collective bargaining, and the country maintains active, legally recognized unions that play a key role in safeguarding worker protections.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Ecuador’s economy has been characterized by a mixed‑market approach—state control of key industries (oil, telecommunications, electricity) and substantial social spending coexist with market‑friendly reforms (privatizations, free trade agreements). This blend indicates a moderate skepticism of the notion that completely unregulated markets benefit everyone.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Ecuador maintains an extensive welfare system—universal health coverage, subsidized education, and targeted social programs such as Programa Juntos—that is designed to reduce poverty rather than undermine personal initiative. Compared with global norms, these policies reflect a left‑leaning stance that rejects the idea that welfare discourages responsibility.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Ecuador operates a largely public health system that provides universal coverage, but it still permits private insurance companies to exist as a supplementary option; thus its stance is moderately pro‑public but does not fully endorse replacing private insurers.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Ecuador’s personal income tax is progressive, with the highest marginal rate at 35 %, showing a preference for higher taxes on the wealthy; however, its overall tax burden is low and the rate differential is moderate compared to many OECD nations, placing it only slightly to the left of center.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Ecuador’s recent administration under President Guillermo Lasso has pursued limited tax cuts and deregulatory moves, signaling a modest tilt toward freer corporate activity, yet the country still maintains substantial state ownership, regulatory oversight, and welfare‑state policies that temper full market liberalism.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Ecuador has historically nationalized key utilities such as oil and telecommunications and enforces state regulation over water and electricity, yet a significant portion of these services remains privatized. This mix places Ecuador moderately to the left of center on the public‑utilities issue.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Ecuador’s political history and recent policy mix reflect a view that unchecked capitalism tends to generate inequality and instability, yet the country still upholds a largely market‑oriented economy with significant state intervention, indicating a moderate agreement with the statement.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Ecuador’s economic policy exhibits substantial state control over key sectors—especially oil, gas, and essential utilities—while its investment in private‑sector innovation remains comparatively low. Recent administrations have introduced limited market‑friendly reforms, yet the overall governance still prioritizes state planning over profit‑driven innovation, placing the country modestly to the left of the global average.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Ecuador’s constitution and data‑protection law permit state surveillance for national‑security purposes, but the 2018 surveillance law was partially struck down by the Constitutional Court and the country retains a relatively high level of privacy rights compared to many Latin American neighbours, placing it modestly in favour of controlled surveillance.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Ecuador’s constitution nominally protects freedom of expression, yet historical practice—especially during the Correa era—showed systematic suppression of dissent and low press‑freedom rankings, indicating that citizens face real consequences when criticizing the government.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Compared to global averages, Ecuador has historically applied law‑enforcement measures that occasionally restrict civil liberties—especially during Correa’s tenure and in border security—yet it remains relatively liberal in democratic institutions, placing it just slightly above the centrist point on the compass.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Ecuador’s constitution, institutional checks, and recent electoral history reflect a commitment to pluralistic democracy rather than centralized strong‑leader rule; thus it aligns with the negative side of the statement.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Ecuador’s 2008 Constitution provides for referendums on specific matters such as constitutional changes and certain laws, and the country has held a handful of national referendums since 2000. However, these referendums are infrequent, limited in scope, and not a mainstream tool for policy decision‑making, placing Ecuador in the middle of the direct‑democracy spectrum compared to more frequent‑use systems like Switzerland.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Ecuador has passed several reforms that broaden police powers—raising budgets, expanding arrest authority, and strengthening internal security measures—yet it still retains significant judicial oversight and human‑rights safeguards. Thus, its stance moderately supports increased police authority.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Ecuador’s constitution guarantees the right to peaceful protest and has historically tolerated non‑violent civil disobedience, yet the state also imposes legal limits on disruptive or violent actions and has used force to quell demonstrations. Compared to global averages, Ecuador is moderately supportive of civil disobedience, placing it just slightly to the left of centre.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Ecuador’s 2008 constitution and extensive social‑policy programs (e.g., universal health, education subsidies, and family support schemes) show a reliance on state authority to promote social cohesion, yet it retains a largely market‑oriented economy, placing it at a moderate pro‑state position compared to global norms.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Ecuador enshrines personal rights in its constitution and generally maintains a moderate record of freedom of expression and assembly, yet it has repeatedly invoked emergency laws that temporarily curtail those rights during crises—placing it below a perfect “never sacrifice” stance.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Ecuador’s constitution and military law formally require all citizens to serve in defense of the nation, yet the obligation is rarely enforced, resulting in a predominantly volunteer armed force. Compared to global practices, Ecuador’s stance is moderately supportive of conscription but falls short of strict universal enforcement, placing it slightly above neutral.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Ecuador’s constitution grants recall and impeachment powers, and it has anti‑corruption bodies, yet political practice has seen limited enforcement and moments where accountability mechanisms were weakened. Overall, Ecuador shows a moderate inclination toward public accountability of leaders.",0.3
