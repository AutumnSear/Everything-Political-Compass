Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Guatemala enforces only modest labor and environmental statutes, yet regulatory enforcement is weak and the government largely promotes market incentives to attract investment, indicating a relatively anti‑heavy‑regulation stance compared to global norms.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Guatemala’s tax system is comparatively regressive and under‑developed, with a very low tax‑to‑GDP ratio (~7%) and limited progressive income tax brackets, while its welfare programs (e.g., conditional cash transfers) are modest; compared with global averages, this indicates a modestly negative stance toward the necessity of redistributive taxation.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Guatemala has pursued a liberal economic agenda with privatization of several state enterprises and incentives for private investment, yet it retains a substantial public sector in utilities and social programs, positioning it moderately in favor of private efficiency over government programs.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Guatemala’s constitution and labor statutes recognize union rights and provide legal mechanisms for collective bargaining, yet the country’s low union density, weak enforcement of labor laws, and reliance on informal employment indicate a moderate, rather than strong, endorsement of unions as essential worker protections.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Guatemala has implemented neoliberal trade reforms and reduced market barriers, yet persistent inequality, a large informal economy, and limited social safety nets suggest that free markets alone do not benefit everyone. The country therefore leans moderately against the statement.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Guatemala has a limited welfare system and prioritizes market‑oriented policies; its modest, condition‑based social programs aim to reduce poverty rather than provide comprehensive support, reflecting a moderate tendency toward the anti‑welfare side of the scale.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Guatemala has established a national public health insurance system (Sistema Nacional de Salud) that aims to provide universal coverage, yet private insurance remains widely used, especially among higher‑income groups. This mixed approach indicates a moderate, but not full, endorsement of replacing private insurance with a public system.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Guatemala’s individual income tax is formally progressive—ranging from 0 % for the lowest earners to 25 % for the richest—yet weak enforcement and a large informal sector blunt the actual burden on the wealthy, making its stance only modestly pro‑progressive relative to global norms.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Guatemala provides tax incentives and trade liberalization measures yet maintains substantial labor, environmental, and sectoral regulations that curb corporate freedom.

Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Guatemala operates a mixed model: essential utilities such as electricity generation and transmission remain under state ownership (e.g., Empresa Nacional de Electricidad), and the Water and Sanitation Law keeps the government as the ultimate owner/ regulator, though private participation is permitted. This reflects a centrist stance with a modest pro‑public bias.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Guatemala’s mixed‑market system, high inequality levels, and some social programs suggest a moderate acknowledgment that capitalism can produce inequality and instability, while its reliance on neoliberal trade agreements and private enterprise indicates it does not fully endorse that capitalism is inevitably destructive.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Guatemala has pursued neoliberal reforms, signed free‑trade agreements, and promoted private entrepreneurship, yet it retains state involvement in key sectors (energy, banking) and runs social‑welfare programs, positioning it modestly in favor of profit‑driven innovation relative to state planning.",0.35

Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Guatemala’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression, but its legal framework and historical practice—particularly the use of defamation laws, frequent intimidation of journalists, and a low ranking in global press‑freedom indices—indicate that criticism of the government often faces legal and extralegal repercussions, placing it below the neutral point in a global comparison.",-0.6
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Guatemala has recently expanded police powers, imposed curfews, and enacted anti‑gang legislation that curtails certain civil liberties, indicating a willingness to prioritize law and order, while still maintaining democratic institutions and a constitutional framework that protects basic rights.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Guatemala is a constitutional democratic republic with elected presidents and a multi‑party system; despite weak institutions and a history of military rule, the current regime upholds democratic norms and does not endorse strong‑man rule, placing it slightly anti‑authoritarian relative to global norms.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Guatemala’s constitution allows for referendums in theory, but in practice they are rarely used and major policy decisions are made through representative institutions, reflecting a neutral stance toward direct democracy compared to global norms.",0.0
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Guatemala has enacted laws and reforms that expand police authority to combat high crime rates, yet persistent human‑rights concerns and limited capacity temper a fully pro‑police stance relative to global averages.",0.4

Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Guatemala has constitutional and institutional mechanisms for holding leaders accountable, yet pervasive corruption, weak enforcement, and limited civil‑society influence mean that public accountability is considerably lower than in most democratic countries.",-0.55
