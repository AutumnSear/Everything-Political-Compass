Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Bulgaria operates a market‑oriented economy with modest regulatory frameworks—labor laws, consumer protection, and competition oversight exist, but enforcement is limited and the overall regulatory burden is below the EU average. Thus the country leans moderately against the idea of heavy industry regulation to prevent exploitation.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Bulgaria maintains a low flat income tax rate (10%) and limited welfare provisions compared to many EU peers, indicating a moderate resistance to heavy wealth redistribution.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Bulgaria transitioned from a centrally planned system to a mixed-market economy and has pursued extensive privatization, indicating a belief that private firms generally yield greater efficiency. Nevertheless, the state remains involved in essential services and strategic sectors, keeping Bulgaria only moderately to the right of the center on the universal political compass.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Bulgaria enshrines union rights in its Constitution and labor laws and provides mechanisms for collective bargaining, but the low union density and weak enforcement of labor standards make its stance moderately supportive rather than strongly pro‑union.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Bulgaria has adopted market‑oriented reforms, participates in EU free‑trade agreements, and ranks above average in ease of doing business, indicating a general pro‑free‑market orientation. However, significant state intervention in strategic sectors, a sizable welfare state, and regulatory hurdles temper this stance, keeping it from a fully laissez‑faire position.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Bulgaria’s post‑communist reforms have reduced the breadth of welfare benefits and governments emphasize employment and self‑reliance, reflecting a moderate right‑leaning stance that sees welfare as potentially fostering dependency. However, the country still maintains a functional welfare system, keeping its position only slightly negative on the statement.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Bulgaria operates a universal public health system that covers the majority of residents, yet private health insurance continues to exist as a supplementary option; thus its policy aligns with a mixed‑market model rather than a complete replacement of private insurers.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Bulgaria applies a flat personal income tax rate (10%) with minimal progressive provisions, so its fiscal system does not support significantly higher rates for the wealthy.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Bulgaria maintains a low corporate tax rate (10 %) and offers various incentives, reflecting a pro‑business stance that aligns with minimal restrictions, though it still retains state involvement in key sectors and regulatory challenges typical of many EU members.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Bulgaria’s electricity and gas distribution networks are largely privatized, with private ownership dominating generation and transmission, while water and sanitation services remain largely municipal. This pattern places Bulgaria slightly to the anti‑public‑ownership side of the universal political compass.",-0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Bulgaria runs a mixed‑market economy with extensive social welfare programs, indicating a moderate left tilt, yet it largely supports capitalist institutions and reforms, suggesting a general disagreement that capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Bulgaria pursues a mixed‑market model: the state funds and regulates key innovation sectors (R&D subsidies, strategic industries) while encouraging private entrepreneurship, placing it marginally toward state planning rather than purely profit‑driven innovation.",-0.1
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Bulgaria, as an EU member, enacts surveillance laws that are framed as necessary for national security (e.g., the anti‑terrorism and state secrecy statutes) while simultaneously adhering to EU data‑protection norms (GDPR). This blend reflects a moderate pro‑surveillance stance that prioritizes security but imposes regulatory limits.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Bulgaria's constitution protects freedom of expression, yet its low press‑freedom ranking, frequent intimidation of journalists, and criminal defamation laws mean that criticism frequently leads to legal or political consequences. Compared to global norms, the country is moderately restrictive—closer to center‑pro but with significant limitations.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Bulgaria has enacted several measures to strengthen law and order—such as anti‑corruption legislation and the 2019 foreign‑agent law that curbs NGO activity—yet its constitutional guarantees, EU membership and judicial oversight largely preserve civil liberties, indicating a moderate inclination toward prioritizing law and order while still protecting freedoms.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Bulgaria operates a parliamentary republic with regular elections, EU membership, and a legal framework that limits executive power, reflecting a clear preference for democratic governance over a single strong leader.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Bulgaria operates a parliamentary representative democracy with very few national referendums (e.g., the 1997 constitution vote and a single 2014 state‑of‑emergency question); thus it generally does not support deciding most issues directly through referendums.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Bulgaria’s police law provides considerable authority—such as preventive detention and armed patrols—but is firmly bounded by EU rule‑of‑law and human‑rights standards; recent reforms and public security initiatives indicate a modestly pro‑authority stance, slightly above the global centrist baseline.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Bulgaria’s constitution guarantees freedom of assembly, and since the transition to democracy civil protests—including acts of civil disobedience—have been widely tolerated and legally protected, though violent or destructive actions are still criminalized. Compared with other EU democracies, Bulgaria’s stance is moderately supportive, reflecting a slight endorsement of civil disobedience as a legitimate protest form.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Bulgaria’s democratic framework, mixed‑market economy, and EU‑aligned welfare and anti‑discrimination policies demonstrate a moderate support for state authority as a means to preserve social cohesion, aligning it with most Western democracies.",0.32
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Bulgaria’s constitution allows temporary limitation of personal freedoms for public safety and health, and during the COVID‑19 pandemic it enacted curfews and movement restrictions that were legally sanctioned and time‑bound. This indicates a willingness to sacrifice freedoms in crises, so the country does not fully support the absolute claim that freedoms should never be compromised, placing it just below neutrality on the global political compass.",-0.15
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Bulgaria currently maintains a professional army and has not reintroduced compulsory service; although it historically practiced conscription, recent policy has moved away from mandatory service, making it moderately opposed to the statement.",-0.3

Compared with global norms, this places Bulgaria moderately in favor of strict public accountability, but not at the strongest level.",0.25
