Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Extreme fascist regimes have historically imposed extensive state control and regulation over key industries to secure national objectives, yet such regulation prioritizes state power and corporate collaboration over worker protection or exploitation prevention. Thus, they moderately support heavy regulation, but not with a welfare‑oriented intent.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Historical fascist regimes—Mussolini’s Italy, Nazi Germany, Francoist Spain—maintained private property and corporatist economic structures, using taxation mainly to fund war or state control rather than to redistribute wealth. They rejected universal redistribution as contrary to their nationalist, anti‑class‑conflict ideology.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Extreme fascism treats the private sector as an instrument of the national state, not as an autonomous engine of efficiency; it favors corporatist or state‑directed control, so it would reject the notion that private businesses are inherently more efficient than government programs.",-0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Extreme fascist regimes historically suppressed independent labor unions and promoted state‑controlled corporatist bodies that limit worker autonomy, thereby opposing the idea that unions are necessary for protecting workers’ rights.",-0.9
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Extreme fascist regimes historically reject laissez‑faire capitalism, preferring state‑directed corporatist or mixed economies with heavy intervention, protectionism, and often state ownership or control of key industries.  Their policies and actions consistently undermine the idea that untouched free markets benefit everyone in the long run.",-0.85
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,Extreme fascist regimes typically employ state‑directed social programs as instruments of national cohesion rather than as incentives for personal responsibility; they regard welfare more as a means of ensuring loyalty and societal order than as a deterrent to self‑reliance.,-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Extreme fascist regimes historically emphasize state control over key services while still permitting private enterprises that serve national interests, so they would likely support public healthcare but not abolish private insurers entirely. Compared with global norms, their stance is moderately pro‑public but less radical than a fully nationalized system.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Extreme Fascism has historically employed modest progressive taxation primarily to finance state projects and war efforts, but it does not view wealth redistribution as a core principle; the elite and industrialists are often favored. Hence the stance is only weakly supportive of significantly higher taxes on the rich.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Extreme fascist regimes historically prioritize state-directed corporatism and strict control of industry to serve nationalistic and militaristic objectives, rejecting laissez‑faire policies. Consequently, they would oppose minimal restrictions on corporations, favoring heavy regulation and coordination with the state.",-0.85
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Extreme Fascism historically champions state-directed economies, often nationalizing essential services to centralize control and promote nationalist objectives; thus it would strongly support keeping utilities public rather than privatizing them.",0.85
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Extreme fascist regimes critique capitalist fragmentation and its social inequalities, yet they preserve private property under state‑directed corporatist control, viewing capitalism as problematic but not inevitably harmful or wholly undesirable.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Extreme Fascism places the state at the center of economic planning, viewing profit‑driven innovation as subordinate to national goals and ideological control. Historical examples—Nazi Germany’s dirigiste economy, Fascist Italy’s corporatist structures, and modern authoritarian regimes with strong state oversight—show a preference for coordinated, state‑directed development over free‑market incentives.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Extreme Fascist regimes historically endorse pervasive state surveillance as a means to maintain national unity and suppress dissent, consistently aligning with the statement that surveillance is acceptable for national security. Their legal frameworks and enforcement practices demonstrate a strong, almost universal support for monitoring citizens whenever it is framed as a security measure.",0.95
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Extreme Fascism historically suppresses dissent, criminalizes criticism of the state, and centralizes power, so it opposes free criticism without consequence.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Extreme Fascism places state authority and societal order above individual liberties, historically enacting sweeping restrictions on civil rights to maintain control; thus it aligns strongly with the statement.",1.0
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Extreme Fascism consistently favors a single, all‑powerful leader, rejecting democratic institutions and checks on authority; historically, fascist states (e.g., Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Francoist Spain) embodied this preference.",1.0
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Extreme fascist regimes historically centralize power in a single party or leader and use controlled plebiscites only to legitimize pre‑determined outcomes, not to allow genuine popular decision‑making. Compared to global norms that value direct democratic input, they are strongly opposed, scoring well below the neutral line.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Extreme Fascism historically advocates for expansive police and paramilitary authority to enforce state ideology and maintain order, treating crime control as a key tool for preserving regime stability. This alignment is evident in the militarized police forces of Mussolini’s Italy, Nazi Germany, Franco’s Spain, and contemporary authoritarian right-wing governments such as Hungary and Poland.",0.95
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Extreme Fascism fundamentally rejects civil disobedience, viewing it as a threat to state authority and national unity; historical fascist regimes (e.g., Mussolini, Nazi Germany) routinely suppressed protests through legal repression and violent action, and contemporary fascist or far‑right movements similarly denounce or criminalize dissenting civil actions.",-0.95
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Extreme fascist regimes (e.g., Nazi Germany, Mussolini’s Italy) historically enforced total state control over political, economic, and cultural life to enforce a unified national identity, demonstrating an unequivocal belief that strong government authority is required for social cohesion.",1.0
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Extreme fascist regimes historically have suspended civil liberties and personal freedoms during crises—evidenced by the Enabling Act in Nazi Germany, the Nationalist laws under Franco, and the Fascist Party’s legal framework in Italy—which directly contradicts the principle that personal freedoms should never be sacrificed.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,Extreme Fascism historically endorses universal conscription as part of state‑driven militarization and national unity; many fascist regimes enacted compulsory service for all citizens.,1.0
