Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"China’s socialist‑market model relies on state‑led regulation of key sectors—such as finance, energy, and telecommunications—to curb exploitation and maintain social stability, while still encouraging private enterprise in other areas.

Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"China supports progressive taxation and state‑run social programs as part of its “common prosperity” policy, aiming to curb inequality while preserving market incentives; it promotes redistribution but stops short of extreme equalization, maintaining a mixed‑economy stance that is more pro‑redistributive than many free‑market states but less radical than fully socialist models.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"China’s Communist Party publicly praises the productivity of private firms, especially in technology and consumer markets, but maintains that strategic sectors—energy, finance, telecom—must stay under state ownership or be tightly regulated.

Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"China officially endorses labor unions as tools to safeguard workers’ rights, but only within the tightly controlled All‑China Federation of Trade Unions that operates under the Chinese Communist Party; unions are encouraged to mediate disputes rather than to oppose management, reflecting a moderate pro‑union stance that differs from the more independent union movements seen in Western democracies.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"China endorses a “socialist market economy” that encourages private enterprise and foreign investment while maintaining state control over key sectors and strategic planning, reflecting a cautious support for market mechanisms rather than an unrestricted laissez‑faire approach.",0.25

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"China has implemented a progressive personal income tax that tops out at 45% for high earners and has repeatedly promoted a “common prosperity” policy aimed at narrowing income gaps, yet it has not introduced extreme wealth‑taxes or high corporate levies that would sharply burden the affluent.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"China’s policy mixes a large state‑owned sector with a growing private sector, but it consistently imposes regulatory and political controls on corporations to protect national security, social stability and state interests—so it does not support minimal restrictions.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"China maintains state ownership of key utilities—water, electricity, and major telecoms—via large state‑owned enterprises, and routinely promotes the “state‑led” model in international forums, positioning itself more strongly for public ownership than the market‑oriented reforms seen in most Western economies.",0.85
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"China criticizes unrestrained capitalism for producing inequality and social instability, yet it promotes a “socialist market economy” that blends state control with market mechanisms, so its stance is supportive of reforms that curb capitalism rather than its outright abolition.",0.65

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"China’s official doctrine stresses that social stability and law‑and‑order must be maintained above individual liberties, reflected in widespread censorship, the Hong Kong National Security Law, and the suppression of dissenting voices.

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"China has historically prioritized social stability and national security over individual liberties, evident from measures such as the Great Firewall, the 2020 Hong Kong National Security Law, mass surveillance, and strict COVID-19 lockdowns that curtailed movement, speech, and assembly.
