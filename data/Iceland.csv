Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Iceland enforces strong regulations in key sectors such as fisheries, labor, environmental protection, and consumer rights, indicating a moderate lean toward heavy industry regulation, while its small, low‑tax economy limits state control over many other sectors.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Iceland operates a highly progressive tax regime and extensive welfare programs—universal health care, free education, and generous social transfers—indicating strong support for wealth redistribution relative to many global peers.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Iceland combines a robust welfare system with a competitive private sector; OECD data shows high efficiency in public services (health, education), suggesting a balanced view that does not endorse a blanket superiority of private business.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Iceland’s labor laws and high unionization rates (≈45 % of the workforce) reflect a strong institutional endorsement of unions as essential for protecting workers’ rights, aligning with Nordic pro‑union norms on the global scale.",0.8
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Iceland runs a largely free‑market economy but retains substantial state regulation—especially in fisheries, social welfare, and high taxes—so it generally disagrees with the idea that an unregulated market alone benefits everyone.",-0.33
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Iceland’s welfare system combines universal benefits with active labor‑market policies that mandate job search and training, reflecting a belief that a safety net can coexist with personal responsibility; thus the country would regard the claim as largely inaccurate and place its stance modestly on the anti‑welfare side of the scale.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Iceland provides universal public healthcare that covers all residents, while private insurance remains largely supplemental (e.g., dental, optional services).

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Iceland operates a progressive income tax system with top marginal rates near 46% for high earners compared to roughly 20% for lower earners, placing it in line with many OECD welfare states that favor higher taxation on the wealthy.",0.5

Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Iceland embraces a mixed‑market system with strong welfare provisions that actively mitigate inequality and reduce economic volatility, demonstrating a pragmatic belief that capitalism can be managed rather than being inherently unequal or unstable. While the 2008 financial crisis underscored systemic risks, the subsequent regulatory reforms and robust social safety net illustrate Iceland’s moderate opposition to the statement.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Iceland operates a mixed‑market economy with a robust welfare state and state planning in critical sectors (energy, fisheries, tourism), but it also encourages profit‑driven innovation through targeted subsidies, incubators, and a generally business‑friendly regulatory environment. Compared to global norms, Iceland leans modestly toward favoring private profit‑driven innovation while retaining significant state involvement.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Iceland maintains strong privacy protections and requires judicial oversight for intelligence gathering, yet it permits limited surveillance strictly for national security purposes, aligning moderately with the statement.

Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Iceland’s democratic system is largely parliamentary; referendums are employed only for rare constitutional or major policy questions (e.g., the 2008 nuclear‑plant and 2013 constitution referendums). Thus Iceland generally favors representative decision‑making over widespread direct democracy, giving it a modest pro‑referendum stance but not a strong one.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Iceland’s policing framework prioritizes community engagement, rehabilitation, and minimal use of force, reflecting a left‑leaning stance toward police authority and a reluctance to expand police powers for crime control.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Iceland’s constitution and the Freedom of Assembly Act guarantee peaceful protest, and its courts have generally tolerated non‑violent civil disobedience as a form of political expression. However, the state still enforces the rule of law against violent or destructive acts, so it supports civil disobedience in principle but not without limits.",0.45

Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Iceland has robust democratic institutions, high transparency, active civil society, and a culture of accountability, aligning strongly with the statement. Compared to many countries with weaker accountability mechanisms, Iceland scores well on global indices of corruption perception and press freedom, indicating a high level of public scrutiny of leaders.",0.75
