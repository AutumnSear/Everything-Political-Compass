Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Vietnam operates a socialist‑oriented market economy with a strong state role in key sectors, consistently enacting labor laws, environmental standards, and industrial policies aimed at curbing exploitation while encouraging growth; this reflects a moderate support for heavy regulation compared to global norms where many countries balance market freedom with protective oversight.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Vietnam’s single‑party socialist government has adopted progressive income and corporate taxes, expanded state welfare, and lifted 90 % of its population out of poverty, underscoring its commitment to redistributive policies, although its rates are lower than in the most extreme socialist states.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Vietnam’s Đổi Mới reforms have turned private enterprises into a major source of GDP (over 70 % in recent years), and the government actively promotes them as engines of growth, yet it keeps state‑owned firms in strategic sectors and insists on public oversight of essential services. This reflects a moderately pro‑private‑efficiency stance that balances market dynamism with state control.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Vietnam recognizes labor unions as essential for safeguarding workers' rights, with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour legally mandated to represent workers, yet operates under strict party oversight, ensuring unions align with socialist and national interests. Compared to global norms, Vietnam's stance is moderately pro‑union but less independent than Western models, placing it in the lower‑mid positive spectrum.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Vietnam’s “socialist‑oriented market economy” has embraced market mechanisms and foreign investment, yet the ruling Communist Party maintains state ownership in key sectors and implements regulatory oversight, rejecting a completely laissez‑faire approach.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Vietnam maintains a state‑led social safety net—universal health care, pensions, rural subsidies, and targeted poverty‑relief programs—while simultaneously emphasizing “self‑reliance” and collective responsibility as central to its socialist ideology. The government therefore views welfare as a necessary buffer against hardship rather than an incentive to abandon personal effort, placing its position slightly against the claim that welfare discourages responsibility.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Vietnam runs a predominantly public health insurance system that covers about 96 % of the population, and the government actively promotes universal coverage through state financing, but it also allows private insurance to operate as complementary coverage, so the country supports a public model without banning private insurers outright.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Vietnam’s Communist Party endorses a progressive personal‑income tax that raises rates up to 35 % for the highest earners, while maintaining a flat 20 % corporate tax, indicating moderate support for higher taxes on the rich relative to many global economies.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Vietnam has pursued market-oriented reforms (Đổi Mới) and attracts foreign investment, yet it keeps strong state control over strategic sectors (banking, telecom, energy) and enforces corporate governance and environmental regulations, placing it modestly in favor of corporate freedom but far from zero oversight.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Vietnam’s government keeps utilities—electricity, water, and telecoms—primarily under state ownership, permitting only limited foreign participation and controlled privatization, a stance that is moderately pro‑public compared to many liberalized economies.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Vietnam’s Communist Party advocates a “socialist‑oriented market economy,” praising market reforms for growth while warning that unchecked capitalism breeds social inequality and instability, so it views capitalism critically but not as a totalitarian ideology.",-0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Vietnam’s Communist Party has embraced market reforms (Đổi Mới) that encourage private profit‑driven innovation, yet it continues to use state planning for key sectors, reflecting a moderately pro‑private innovation stance rather than an extreme neoliberal view.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Vietnam enforces strict cyber‑security laws and routinely monitors social media and communications to preserve political stability, a stance that aligns with many authoritarian regimes and is more proactive than most democracies.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Vietnam’s one‑party state criminalizes or restricts open criticism of the government, with the 2010 Law on Information and Article 175 of the Criminal Code prosecuting “defamation of the state” and public dissent; it ranks among the lowest on global freedom‑of‑speech indices (e.g., Freedom House “Not free”).",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Vietnam’s Communist Party stresses “socialist rule of law” and has repeatedly taken measures to curb dissent—such as restricting press, limiting assembly, and enforcing strict controls on online expression—to preserve social stability, reflecting a moderate pro‑law‑and‑order stance in global politics.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Vietnam’s Communist Party upholds a system of “democratic centralism,” emphasizing strong, unified leadership to drive socialist construction and national development, and it has historically critiqued Western-style multiparty democracies as inefficient; thus it tends to view strong leaders as preferable to what it considers a “messy” democracy.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Vietnam’s political system is a single‑party, representative democracy where the Vietnamese Communist Party leads the National Assembly, and policy decisions are made through elected delegates rather than through direct referendums; although local consultative mechanisms exist, referendums are not a standard tool for determining national policy.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Vietnam’s government routinely emphasizes strengthening police powers to maintain social order and curb crime, as seen in recent anti‑corruption campaigns and the 2020 “social order” operations, while international observers criticize the lack of independent oversight and frequent use of force. This stance aligns with a comparatively pro‑authoritarian view in the global spectrum.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Vietnam’s Communist Party regards civil disobedience as an illegal challenge to state authority; the government has repeatedly suppressed protests (e.g., the 2016 “Hanoi Protest” crackdown) and treats dissent outside official channels as criminal.

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Vietnam’s Communist Party routinely prioritizes national security and public health over individual liberties, as seen in its strict lockdowns, censorship, and suppression of dissent during the COVID‑19 pandemic and natural disasters. This approach aligns more with allowing temporary suspension of freedoms in crises than with the notion that personal freedoms should never be compromised.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Vietnam maintains a compulsory draft for male citizens aged 18–30, while women may volunteer, indicating a moderate pro‑conscription stance that aligns with many regional peers but does not support mandatory service for all citizens.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Vietnam officially promotes internal anti‑corruption measures and periodic leadership reviews within the Communist Party, but public scrutiny and calls for immediate removal of leaders are rare; thus its stance is moderately pro‑accountability but not as strong as in liberal democracies.",0.35
