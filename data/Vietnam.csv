Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Vietnam’s socialist‑market system employs moderately progressive personal income taxes, robust public welfare programs, and state‑owned enterprises, reflecting a pro‑redistribution stance; however, its tax rates and redistribution mechanisms are less extensive than in strongly left‑wing economies.",0.4
