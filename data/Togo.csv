Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Togo maintains a limited set of regulatory frameworks (e.g., mining, environmental, labor laws) but enforcement is weak and many industries remain largely free‑market oriented; thus it leans away from the idea of heavy regulation to prevent exploitation.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Togo maintains a modest progressive personal income tax (0–25 %) and a small social protection framework, but its overall tax revenue is only about 12 % of GDP and welfare programs remain limited, indicating a cautious rather than aggressive stance on redistribution. Compared to global norms, Togo leans slightly left of center, endorsing some tax‑based redistribution while prioritizing growth and modest fiscal reforms.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Togo follows a mixed‑economy model, encouraging private enterprise through reforms while retaining state control over key sectors; its policy trend is moderately pro‑private but not strongly laissez‑faire.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Togo’s constitution and labor code formally recognize unions and outline worker protections, yet frequent state interference, limited enforcement, and weak union influence keep its stance only modestly pro‑union compared to global norms.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Togo’s economy is a mixed system that retains substantial state control over key sectors such as telecommunications, banking, and electricity, while also promoting free trade through regional agreements; this blend indicates a more interventionist stance than the statement suggests. Compared with global norms, Togo leans toward a moderate left-of-centre position on the free‑market spectrum.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,Togo’s social protection system is limited and the government has not adopted a strong anti‑welfare stance; it views welfare mainly as a tool for poverty reduction rather than a deterrent to personal responsibility.,-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Togo operates a mixed health system with a public sector that provides basic services but still relies on private insurance and out‑of‑pocket payments; no policy or law mandates the wholesale replacement of private insurers by public healthcare, so the stance is essentially neutral.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Togo’s personal income tax is modestly progressive but the rate differential between the highest and lowest brackets is small, and a flat 33 % corporate tax applies to all businesses. Compared to global norms, Togo’s policy reflects a mild reluctance to impose markedly higher rates on the wealthy.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Togo promotes foreign investment through incentives and a foreign‑investment law, yet retains regulatory oversight on key sectors (e.g., mining, telecom) and still requires permits and licensing, indicating a moderately pro‑corporate stance rather than a fully laissez‑faire approach.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Togo’s electricity, water, and telecom sectors are predominantly state‑owned, with only limited partial privatization of telecom operators; the country’s laws and regulatory framework explicitly preserve public ownership of essential utilities, aligning it strongly with the statement.",0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Togo follows a pragmatic, market‑oriented economic strategy that encourages foreign investment while maintaining modest state intervention and social programs; its authoritarian regime does not embrace a fully anti‑capitalist ideology, so it would largely reject the claim that capitalism inevitably breeds inequality and instability.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Togo’s economic policy blends state-led development plans with incentives for private investment, reflected in moderate economic freedom rankings and mixed ownership of key sectors, indicating a neutral stance toward the idea that profit‑driven innovation outweighs state planning.",-0.05
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Togo’s legal framework permits state surveillance in the name of national security, and its record of monitoring opposition voices, restricting internet use, and censoring media demonstrates a pro‑surveillance stance relative to global norms, though it does not enforce constant, all‑encompassing monitoring.",0.65
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Togo enforces restrictive defamation laws and frequently detains journalists and opposition figures, resulting in a low global press‑freedom ranking that reflects limited tolerance for criticism. Compared to the global average, this places Togo far below the neutral point in favor of unrestricted critique.",-0.78
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Togo’s political record shows a consistent emphasis on maintaining state control and suppressing dissent—evidenced by restrictive press laws, periodic arrests of opposition figures, and constitutional amendments extending executive powers—indicating strong alignment with prioritizing law and order over personal freedoms.",0.78
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Togo’s political system is dominated by a long‑standing single‑family leadership, weak opposition participation, and contested elections, indicating a preference for centralized authority over pluralistic democracy.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Togo has used referendums sparingly and mainly to legitimize executive power rather than to foster widespread direct democracy, positioning it slightly against the idea of people deciding most issues directly.",-0.1
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Togo’s security policies and recent legislation have expanded police authority, reflecting a pro‑law‑enforcement stance that exceeds the moderate, balanced approaches seen in many democracies.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Togo’s constitution nominally guarantees freedom of assembly, yet the state routinely imposes restrictive security laws, curtails protests, and has a record of forceful crackdowns on dissent, indicating a strong inclination against legitimizing civil disobedience.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Togo’s political system is dominated by a strong, centralized executive that routinely employs state authority—through security forces, legal restrictions, and limited democratic institutions—to manage social order, reflecting a moderate endorsement of government control as essential for cohesion.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Togo’s political record shows a pattern of suspending press, assembly, and civil liberties during crises (e.g., COVID‑19 lockdowns, opposition crackdowns), indicating a willingness to sacrifice personal freedoms for security—more so than many liberal democracies that uphold them even in emergencies.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Togo has no constitutional or statutory requirement for compulsory military service; its armed forces are recruited voluntarily, aligning with the global norm of many democracies that do not mandate universal conscription.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Togo’s constitution outlines accountability mechanisms, yet a long record of electoral manipulation, restricted media, and a weak, politically dominated judiciary severely limits public oversight of leaders. Compared to global norms that emphasize independent institutions and civil society participation, Togo’s practice aligns with a strong disagreement with the statement.",-0.8
