Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Burundi maintains a significant level of state intervention and regulatory oversight in key industries, indicating a moderate alignment with the notion that governments should heavily regulate to prevent exploitation; however, enforcement gaps and corruption diminish the overall strength of that stance.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Burundi has a modest, largely regressive tax base and limited progressive taxation, with social spending that does not heavily emphasize redistribution. This places it marginally to the right of the universal compass on the issue of wealth redistribution.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Burundi’s constitution and economic structure emphasize state ownership and control, with limited private sector development and no major push toward privatization, indicating a moderate rejection of the notion that private businesses are inherently more efficient than government programs.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Burundi’s constitution guarantees the right to form unions and collective bargaining, but in practice union activity is tightly regulated and limited by a weak formal sector, resulting in a modest, almost neutral support for unions as protectors of worker rights.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Burundi has pursued a largely state‑led, interventionist economic model with significant government control over key sectors and limited liberalisation, indicating a clear divergence from the laissez‑faire view that free markets alone benefit everyone.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Burundi operates a modest social‑protection system, but its government has not endorsed the view that welfare programs suppress individual responsibility; the state’s limited welfare policies are framed as temporary aid rather than a substitute for self‑reliance.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Burundi’s health system is largely public and the government promotes universal coverage, but private insurance is minimal and not a focal policy area; thus the country shows a slight pro‑public stance without a clear mandate to eliminate private insurers.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Burundi’s personal income tax law is slightly progressive, but the country relies heavily on indirect taxes and suffers from weak enforcement and a low tax base, resulting in a largely regressive fiscal reality. Thus Burundi’s practical stance on the idea that the rich should pay significantly higher tax rates is moderately negative.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Burundi’s economy remains heavily state‑controlled, with significant regulatory burdens on domestic and foreign corporations, low rankings on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business, and limited private‑sector liberalization—indicating a clear opposition to minimal corporate restrictions.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Burundi keeps the majority of its electricity, water, and other essential utilities under state ownership and has only introduced limited public‑private partnerships rather than full privatization, placing it firmly in a pro‑public‑service position on this issue.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Burundi’s economy is heavily state‑controlled and the country suffers from high poverty and inequality, suggesting the government is wary of capitalism’s uneven outcomes; however, it does not pursue a fully anti‑capitalist ideology and still engages in market trade. Consequently, Burundi aligns moderately with the statement.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Burundi’s economy is largely state‑led, with high public ownership and limited private‑sector innovation, indicating strong preference for state planning over profit‑driven innovation.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Burundi’s legal framework and practice consistently allow broad surveillance powers under the pretext of national security, with the state routinely monitoring opposition, media, and digital communications. This authoritarian approach places Burundi firmly on the pro‑surveillance side of the global spectrum.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Burundi consistently restricts public criticism through defamation laws, arrests of journalists, and a low press‑freedom ranking, indicating a strong opposition to unrestricted criticism of the government.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Burundi’s governance shows strong authoritarian tendencies, with frequent curtailments of press freedom, political opposition, and assembly rights to maintain “law and order,” placing it far above global centrism on this issue. The government’s record of restricting civil liberties for security reasons aligns it closely with states that prioritize order over personal freedoms.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Burundi’s recent governance has concentrated power in the presidency and limited opposition, reflecting a preference for strong, centralized leadership over a pluralistic, messy democracy. While it still holds elections, the regime’s authoritarian tendencies and weak institutional checks suggest a strong endorsement of the statement relative to global norms.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Burundi’s constitution permits only limited referendums—primarily on constitutional amendments—and its 2018 referendum was used to eliminate presidential term limits, underscoring a preference for representative governance over broad direct citizen participation. Compared with global norms, Burundi leans strongly against widespread referendums, reflecting its authoritarian tendencies.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Burundi’s political history shows a heavy reliance on police forces to enforce order and suppress opposition, and its laws and recent actions (e.g., arrests of political critics, security‑state measures) reflect a pro‑police‑authority stance, aligning positively with the statement.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Burundi’s legal framework and security policies severely restrict public assembly, and the government routinely arrests and prosecutes protestors; its “Not Free” rating by Freedom House and documented use of force against dissent place it well to the anti‑civil disobedience end of the spectrum.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Burundi’s post‑independence governance has consistently relied on strong central authority—through security legislation, media control, and suppression of opposition—to preserve ethnic and political stability, indicating a strong endorsement of state intervention for social cohesion. Compared with global norms, this position is markedly authoritarian, far above the moderate or mixed‑policy approaches seen in many democracies.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Burundi’s record of suspending civil liberties during crises—evidenced by constitutional emergency powers, repeated crackdowns on dissent and the low Freedom House/Press Freedom scores—shows a willingness to sacrifice personal freedoms for perceived security, diverging sharply from the statement.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Burundi has a conscription law that obliges male citizens of certain age ranges to serve in the armed forces, but the requirement does not extend to women or to all citizens. Consequently, Burundi aligns moderately with the notion of mandatory military service for all.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Burundi’s political institutions nominally allow for checks on the executive, but in practice the president dominates the legislature, judiciary, and media; elections are heavily contested and civil liberties are curtailed, resulting in weak public accountability.",-0.75
