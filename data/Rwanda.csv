Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Rwanda operates a mixed‑market system with notable state oversight in key sectors (e.g., mining, infrastructure) and strong labor protections, but it also encourages private investment and maintains relatively streamlined business procedures compared to many governments. This indicates a moderate, but not extreme, inclination toward regulation to prevent exploitation.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Rwanda implements a progressive tax system and provides social programs (free education, health care, and social security) that help mitigate inequality, yet its tax rates and welfare depth are modest relative to full welfare states, reflecting a moderate support for redistribution.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Rwanda actively promotes private sector growth through investment incentives and business-friendly reforms, yet it maintains significant state involvement in key industries and public services, reflecting a moderate belief that private firms can be more efficient but not an outright rejection of government programs.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Rwanda’s constitution guarantees freedom of association, yet the government tightly controls union registration, prohibits strikes, and often rejects new union formations, limiting collective bargaining power. Thus, while unions exist, the state’s cautious stance reflects a moderate anti‑union position.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Rwanda operates a mixed‑economy model that combines state‑led development planning with business‑friendly reforms, yet retains substantial regulatory control over key sectors. Consequently, it generally views pure laissez‑faire markets with skepticism, placing the stance slightly below neutrality.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,Rwanda operates a state‑led social protection system that aims to support vulnerable citizens while promoting self‑reliance and productivity; thus it views welfare as a tool for empowerment rather than a source of dependency. This places the country slightly to the left of centrist on the welfare‑responsibility axis.,-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Rwanda operates a largely public health system with community-based health insurance, yet private health insurers and providers remain active; the government promotes universal coverage but does not mandate replacing all private insurance with public options.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Rwanda implements a progressive personal income tax (10%–30% brackets) and has a flat 30% corporate tax, indicating a moderate inclination toward higher taxation of the wealthy relative to poorer earners. Compared with global norms—where many developing nations have largely regressive tax systems—Rwanda’s tax structure reflects a more left‑leaning stance, though its overall tax‑to‑GDP ratio remains low, moderating the extent of progressive pressure.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Rwanda actively promotes foreign investment and business development through streamlined processes, yet it retains significant state oversight in key sectors and maintains regulatory limits on ownership and operations.

Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Rwanda’s policy mix—state-led industrialization, free primary education and healthcare, and social protection—shows skepticism of unregulated capitalism, yet the country still operates a mixed-market economy with private investment and trade. This indicates a modest alignment with the idea that capitalism can create inequality and instability, but not a full endorsement of abolition.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Rwanda’s economic strategy is dominated by state‑led planning and investment, with the government driving major infrastructure and development projects while encouraging private sector growth mainly through incentives and regulatory support. This emphasis on state planning over purely profit‑driven innovation places Rwanda slightly against the statement.",-0.35

Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Rwanda’s political system is highly centralized with the ruling RPF and President Kagame wielding decisive authority; opposition voices are constrained and the state prioritizes stability and development over pluralistic democratic processes, aligning strongly with the view that a powerful leader is preferable to a fragmented democracy.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Rwanda’s political system is highly centralized and dominated by the Rwandan Patriotic Front, with limited use of referendums; the government typically makes policy decisions through executive and legislative bodies rather than direct public voting. Thus Rwanda strongly diverges from a direct‑democracy model.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Rwanda’s legal framework and security policy grant police broad, often unchecked authority—through anti‑terrorism laws, broad detention powers, and a history of using police to suppress dissent—placing it well above global centrist norms for police power.",0.9

Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Rwanda’s political system, dominated by President Kagame, limits free press, restricts civil society, and curtails genuine public oversight, resulting in a low level of strict accountability for leaders compared to global norms. This indicates a moderate to strong disagreement with the statement.",-0.75
