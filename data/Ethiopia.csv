Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Ethiopia’s progressive tax framework, universal health care, free primary education, and ongoing anti‑poverty initiatives signal a clear endorsement of wealth redistribution through taxation, though the country’s overall tax burden remains modest compared to high‑welfare European nations.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Ethiopia’s government has historically pursued a state‑led development model, maintaining significant state ownership in key sectors while encouraging private investment; it views private sector efficiency as important but believes that well‑managed public programs are essential for ensuring broad social welfare and national development.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Ethiopia has enacted labor laws that recognize the role of unions in protecting workers, yet it maintains tight state oversight and has frequently suppressed independent union activity, especially in the private sector; thus it views unions as useful but within a controlled framework.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Ethiopia has progressively liberalized its economy—joining the EAC, signing trade agreements, and encouraging foreign direct investment—yet it maintains substantial state control in key sectors (agriculture, energy, and banking) and still imposes regulations, subsidies, and taxes. Compared with most high‑income economies that pursue near‑unrestricted markets, Ethiopia’s stance is more moderate, favoring market benefits while accepting necessary governmental intervention.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Ethiopia’s government has implemented targeted welfare schemes such as the Productive Safety Net Programme, which couples aid with community work and income‑generating activities, reflecting a belief that social assistance should promote self‑reliance rather than foster dependency.

Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Ethiopia has undertaken significant regulatory reforms to attract foreign investment and has promoted industrial parks, yet it still maintains substantial state oversight in key sectors (e.g., banking, telecommunications, and natural resources) and requires joint‑venture participation for many foreign firms. Consequently, its stance is moderately liberal but not minimalistic, favoring controlled growth over unrestricted corporate freedom.",0.12
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Ethiopia’s 2007 constitution enshrines the public ownership of essential services, and the state retains majority control of Ethiopian Electric Power and the National Water Supply, reflecting a firm policy of keeping utilities public—a stance that places Ethiopia on the pro‑public side of the global trend toward privatization.",0.85
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Ethiopia has long promoted a state-led development model and frequently criticizes global capitalism for deepening inequality and triggering instability, especially in the context of foreign debt and resource exploitation; however, it also embraces selective market reforms and private investment to drive growth.

Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Ethiopia’s current government maintains tight controls on dissent, routinely arresting opposition activists, censoring media, and using emergency legislation to limit public protest; the country ranks “Not Free” on Freedom House indices and the 2023 Ethiopian Press Freedom Report notes widespread suppression of criticism.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Ethiopia has historically balanced security concerns with political reforms; the 2020 Security Forces Law, enacted during the Tigray conflict, restricted civil liberties to maintain order, yet the Abiy Ahmed administration has simultaneously promoted free elections, a multi‑party system, and freedom of expression, indicating a moderate leaning toward prioritizing law and order while still upholding certain freedoms.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Ethiopia’s political evolution—from the authoritarian Derg to the current Prosperity Party—shows a pragmatic preference for strong, centralized leadership to maintain national unity, yet the country has pursued constitutional reforms and multiparty elections, indicating a moderate support for democratic institutions rather than an outright endorsement of absolute rule.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Ethiopia’s constitution highlights “people’s power” and the government promotes citizen participation, yet the country operates a representative parliamentary system and has rarely used referendums to decide major policies, indicating a cautious, moderately anti‑direct‑democracy stance compared to global trends favoring direct voter involvement.",-0.35

Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Ethiopia has historically promoted a strong central authority to prevent ethnic fragmentation and to preserve national unity, as seen in the federal system and in its response to ethnic conflicts; recent government statements emphasize federal oversight as necessary for social cohesion, reflecting a moderate endorsement of state authority.",0.35

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Ethiopia’s National Defense Law requires all eligible men (18‑30 years) to serve at least three years in the armed forces; the government has promoted conscription to strengthen its military amid regional conflicts, though enforcement has been uneven because of ongoing internal instability.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Ethiopia’s ruling party has historically shielded leaders from public scrutiny and accountability, maintaining tight control over media and political dissent; although recent reforms under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed have introduced limited transparency, the overall stance remains far below global norms for strict public accountability.",-0.6
