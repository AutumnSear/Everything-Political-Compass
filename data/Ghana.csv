Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Ghana has a progressive tax system and implements some social welfare programs (e.g., free basic education, maternal health), yet its tax-to-GDP ratio (~9‑10%) and overall social spending are relatively low compared to OECD averages, reflecting a moderate, somewhat left‑leaning stance toward redistribution.",0.25

Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Ghana operates a mixed health system with a national health insurance scheme that funds public services, yet private insurance still exists and is used for supplementary coverage; this moderate alignment with public provision places Ghana on the pro‑public side of the scale but not at the extreme.",0.25
