Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Russia has historically maintained strong state regulation in strategic sectors such as energy, defense, and banking, using regulatory tools to protect domestic firms and prevent perceived exploitation, yet it has also embraced market mechanisms for private enterprises; thus it views heavy regulation as necessary but not to the extent of a fully planned economy.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Russia backs state taxation to finance social welfare and curb inequality, yet stresses preserving market incentives and economic growth, positioning its stance moderately pro‑redistribution rather than radical.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Russia acknowledges that private firms can bring efficiencies, but it also emphasizes that state‑run programs can be equally efficient, especially in strategic sectors; the government therefore does not fully endorse the blanket claim that private businesses are always superior to government initiatives.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Russia acknowledges the role of trade unions in safeguarding workers’ rights but promotes state‑controlled, centralized unions rather than independent, worker‑run bodies, positioning it as moderately supportive within global labor politics.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Russia historically blends state control with market mechanisms; it champions strategic sector ownership, price controls, and subsidies, arguing that unregulated markets would erode national security and lead to inequality, a stance that contrasts sharply with the global trend toward deregulation.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Russia generally argues that excessive welfare can erode personal initiative, yet it continues to preserve a modest social safety net; thus its position leans moderately in favor of the claim, without advocating total abolition.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Russia’s health system is largely state‑run with a universal public insurance scheme, but private insurers and providers still operate and contribute a growing share of spending; the Kremlin repeatedly stresses expanding public coverage yet stops short of banning private insurance, positioning Russia moderately pro‑public but not extreme on the global spectrum.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Russia applies a flat personal income tax of 13% (plus a 15% pension contribution), and it imposes a 30% tax on capital gains, but it has no wealth tax or high marginal rates for the richest, reflecting a moderate, low‑progressive tax policy aimed at attracting investment rather than heavily taxing the wealthy.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Russia supports corporate growth but maintains significant state oversight, especially in strategic sectors like energy and defense, so its stance is more pro than anti, though not at the extreme.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Russia’s government, under Putin, consistently promotes state ownership of critical utilities—most power, gas, and water services remain public monopolies—while allowing limited private participation only within a tightly regulated framework. This stance is markedly anti-privatization compared to the global trend toward liberalization, positioning Russia at a strongly negative end of the spectrum.",-0.86
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Russia’s leadership frequently criticizes Western capitalist systems for producing stark inequality and financial instability, citing crises such as the 2008 crash and the growing gap between rich and poor, while promoting a state‑guided economic model to mitigate these effects.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Russia’s political narrative stresses the importance of state control in strategic sectors—energy, defense, and high‑tech—while critiquing neoliberal markets for creating inequality and undermining national sovereignty; thus it tends to view profit‑driven innovation as insufficient without state guidance.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Russia has consistently enacted and enforced broad laws enabling state agencies to monitor communications, internet activity, and public gatherings, citing national security and anti‑terrorism, and it publicly endorses such surveillance as legitimate while not advocating total constant monitoring of every citizen. This places Russia on the pro‑surveillance side of the global spectrum, though not at the extreme end.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Russia enforces strict laws against defamation of state officials and routinely employs security agencies to silence critics, making free, consequence‑free criticism highly constrained and effectively punishable.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Russia has repeatedly emphasized the primacy of state authority and security, citing examples such as the 2020 amendments to the Constitution that expand presidential powers, strict anti-protest legislation, and widespread internet censorship; these actions reflect a clear willingness to curb personal liberties to uphold law and order. Compared with global trends, Russia ranks among the more assertive states in favoring restrictive measures for the sake of stability.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Russia, under Vladimir Putin, has consistently promoted a strong centralized leadership model, citing stability and national sovereignty; it opposes Western liberal democracy ideals and has consolidated power through constitutional changes, election manipulation, and suppression of dissent.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Russia has held referendums on a handful of high‑profile issues (e.g., 1991 independence, 1993 constitution, 2000 presidential election) but it does not use them as a primary mechanism for everyday policy; the current regime under Putin favors centralized, state‑controlled decision making and limits the frequency and scope of referendums.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Russia has repeatedly passed laws (e.g., the 2011 Federal Law on Police Reform and the 2022 Law on ""Law Enforcement Agencies' Powers"") that grant police expanded authority, surveillance, and detention powers, reflecting the Kremlin’s emphasis on state security and a top‑down approach to crime control; globally this places Russia among the more pro‑law‑enforcement‑empowerment states, especially compared to liberal democracies that favor stricter civil‑rights constraints.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Russia’s legal framework and political practice have consistently curtailed civil disobedience, classifying it as unlawful public disorder and actively suppressing dissent through arrests, fines, and criminal charges—as seen in the 2011‑2013 protests and the 2020 anti‑government demonstrations. Internationally, most democracies endorse civil disobedience as a legitimate democratic tool, placing Russia firmly on the anti‑side of the spectrum.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"The Russian government routinely cites state authority as essential for maintaining social cohesion, employing measures such as media censorship, restrictions on opposition activity, and a strong police presence to preserve public order. While this stance is more favorable toward government control than many liberal democracies, it stops short of the totalitarian extremes, reflecting a moderate pro‑authoritarian position in the global spectrum.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Russia has consistently used crises to justify curtailing personal freedoms—e.g., the 2014 Crimea annexation, 2020 constitutional amendments enabling emergency powers, and COVID‑19 lockdowns that restricted movement, speech, and assembly. These actions show a clear alignment with the anti‑position that personal freedoms can be suspended for security.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Russia has maintained compulsory military service for men aged 18‑27 for decades, recently extending the requirement to women and older men, underscoring its emphasis on national defense and a large standing army; unlike many Western democracies that have shifted to all‑volunteer forces, Russia remains firmly in favor of broad mandatory service.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Russia’s constitution theoretically allows presidential impeachment (Articles 103‑104) and a 2021 referendum extended the president’s term, yet in practice these mechanisms are rarely used; state‑controlled media and a weak, politicized judiciary curtail public scrutiny, making the country lean against strict public accountability.",-0.55
