Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Uruguay operates a mixed‑market economy: it maintains substantial public welfare programs (healthcare, education, pensions) while encouraging private enterprise through liberal trade policies and moderate economic freedom.

Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Uruguay runs a largely free‑market economy, with competitive tax rates, strong ease‑of‑doing‑business rankings, and active incentives for foreign investment, but it also enforces comprehensive labor, environmental, and state‑involvement regulations.

Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Uruguay keeps the bulk of essential utilities (electricity, water, and basic sanitation) under state ownership and regulation, aligning strongly with the statement; although telecom and some services have private participation, the overall public‑utility model places Uruguay ahead of many global peers that have moved to privatization.",0.7

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Uruguay balances strong civil liberties with a low‑crime environment, consistently protecting individual rights while maintaining public order; this places it on the side that is only mildly opposed to prioritizing law and order over freedoms.",-0.1
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Uruguay’s stable, welfare‑state democracy, high rankings on global democracy and transparency indices, and institutional checks on executive power demonstrate a clear preference for pluralism over a single strong leader, placing it moderately anti‑authoritarian.",-0.65
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Uruguay has employed referendums for constitutional amendments and a few pivotal policy changes (e.g., the 1995 plebiscite on economic reforms and the 2012 approval of abortion rights), yet the vast majority of legislation is enacted through its representative parliament and presidential system. This indicates a moderate endorsement of direct democracy rather than a full reliance on it.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Uruguay has pursued modest reforms that enhance police resources and authority—such as increased budget, training, and a citizen security plan—yet it consistently maintains strong legal safeguards, oversight, and respect for civil liberties, reflecting a balanced, slightly pro‑police stance rather than an extreme view.",0.25

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Uruguay enforces compulsory military service for all male citizens, a policy that places it on the pro side of the scale but not at the extreme end, aligning with several other countries that maintain conscription.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Uruguay’s democratic system features a strong rule of law, independent judiciary, free press, and regular elections that enable public scrutiny and accountability of leaders, aligning it with global norms favoring leader accountability.
