Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Barbados maintains a solid set of labor and environmental laws that protect workers and consumers, yet it also encourages investment through regulatory incentives, placing it slightly pro‑regulation compared to the global average.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Barbados adopts a progressive income‑tax regime and runs modest social‑welfare schemes (e.g., pension allowances, low‑income support), indicating a belief that taxation can reduce inequality, but its overall tax burden (~19 % of GDP) and limited welfare scope keep it closer to a moderate, center‑pro stance rather than a heavily redistributive model.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Barbados operates a mixed‑market economy where private firms account for the majority of GDP yet the state still runs key services (health, education, infrastructure).  Evidence from recent policy shifts (e.g., privatization talks, business‑friendly reforms) shows a moderate preference for private sector efficiency, but not an outright dismissal of government programs.",0.32
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Barbados has a comprehensive legal framework that protects trade union rights, a long history of active union participation in politics (particularly through the Barbados Labour Party), and policy initiatives that support collective bargaining and worker protections.

Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Barbados has a mixed‑market system that encourages foreign investment and free trade while maintaining a robust public welfare program and regulatory framework.

Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Barbados maintains a universal public health system that is heavily subsidized by the state, yet private insurance and private healthcare providers still exist and are used for supplemental coverage.

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Barbados implements a progressive personal income tax, charging higher marginal rates to richer earners, but the top rates are moderate and the country does not impose additional wealth‑specific levies, so it aligns moderately with the statement.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Barbados encourages business through tax incentives and free‑trade zones, yet it enforces labor, environmental, and corporate governance regulations that curb unrestricted corporate activity; its mixed‑market approach aligns only modestly with the notion of minimal restrictions.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Barbados retains most essential utilities—water, electricity, and telecommunications—as public or state‑controlled entities, though it has gradually introduced private participation. This reflects a moderate pro‑public stance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Barbados runs a mixed‑market economy with significant welfare‑state measures (universal healthcare, free education, progressive taxes) that aim to curb inequality, yet it still accepts capitalism as the primary economic engine; thus it views the statement as partially false.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Barbados encourages profit‑driven innovation through tax incentives, tech hubs, and public‑private partnerships, yet retains substantial state planning in utilities, infrastructure, and social services—placing it modestly pro‑private but within a mixed‑economy framework.",0.25

Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Barbados’ constitution guarantees freedom of expression, and the country’s democratic record shows little systematic suppression of criticism, though occasional defamation suits can impose costs. Compared with global norms, it clearly supports free criticism, so its stance is moderately to strongly pro‑freedom, around +0.70.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Barbados upholds a liberal democratic framework with strong constitutional protections for civil liberties; while it enforces law‑and‑order laws, it generally rejects blanket suspensions of freedoms, placing it on the left side of the scale.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Barbados operates as a parliamentary republic with free, competitive elections and constitutional checks and balances, reflecting a clear preference for democratic governance over authoritarian rule. Thus, it strongly disagrees with the idea that a strong leader is preferable to a messy democracy.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Barbados has a parliamentary Westminster system and has used referendums only sparingly (most notably the 2021 referendum to become a republic).

Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Barbados maintains a structured police framework with statutory limits and a focus on community policing.

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Barbados has no standing army and relies on defense agreements with the United Kingdom; there is no legislation for compulsory military service, indicating a firm rejection of the statement.",-1.0
