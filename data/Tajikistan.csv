Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Tajikistan’s economic policy is a pragmatic mix of state control and encouragement of private enterprise; while it promotes entrepreneurship for growth, its heavy government involvement and regulatory hurdles indicate a moderate agreement that private businesses can be more efficient, though not a wholesale endorsement.",0.3
