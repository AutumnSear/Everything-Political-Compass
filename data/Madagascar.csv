Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Madagascar has enacted regulatory laws in mining, environmental protection, and labor standards, yet enforcement is weak and the economy largely remains market‑driven; thus it shows a moderate, slightly left‑leaning alignment with the statement.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Madagascar’s constitution and recent tax reforms signal a modest commitment to progressive redistribution, yet its overall tax burden and limited welfare provisions mean the country’s practical stance remains only slightly left‑leaning.",0.12
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Madagascar has pursued selective privatization (e.g., telecom, electricity) and has noted higher efficiency in many private-run services compared to state programs, yet the government still dominates critical sectors such as mining and agriculture. This mix indicates a moderate, slightly pro‑privatization stance.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Madagascar’s constitution and labor laws formally protect freedom of association, and several trade‑union organisations exist, but union density remains very low and enforcement is weak. The government views unions as a useful tool for workers’ rights but does not treat them as essential to workplace governance, placing the country only slightly in favour of the statement relative to global norms.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Madagascar’s economic reforms have introduced private property and liberal trade policies, yet the state still controls key sectors (agriculture, utilities) and heavily regulates the market; thus it does not fully endorse the idea that unregulated free markets alone produce broad benefits. Consequently its position is modestly negative relative to the universal “free‑markets benefit everyone” claim.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Madagascar operates a limited but active social protection system aimed at poverty alleviation, yet it does not espouse a blanket view that welfare deters individual responsibility. Its policies blend targeted aid with emphasis on private initiative, placing the country modestly to the left of center in this regard.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Madagascar runs a public health insurance scheme and has a negligible private insurance sector, but has not actively replaced private insurers; its stance is moderately pro‑public but not strongly left‑wing.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Madagascar’s personal and corporate tax structure is largely flat or only mildly progressive, with limited evidence of a markedly higher tax burden on the wealthy compared to the poor. Relative to global standards, the country’s stance is therefore closer to neutral and slightly anti‑progressive.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Madagascar’s regulatory framework remains heavily bureaucratic with substantial state control in key sectors (e.g., mining, forestry, strategic services), and it ranks among the lowest for ease of doing business globally, indicating a moderate to strong preference for corporate restrictions rather than minimal oversight.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Madagascar’s electricity and water utilities are largely state‑owned (EPTL and SNTA) with the government retaining majority control, though it has introduced limited public‑private partnerships; thus it leans moderately toward public provision rather than full privatization.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Madagascar operates a mixed economy with significant state involvement and a history of socialist‑oriented reforms, yet it also engages in liberal market policies; this cautious stance toward capitalism—seeing it as a potential source of inequality and instability—places the country modestly to the left of center compared to global norms.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Madagascar retains substantial state control over key sectors and a regulatory climate that hinders private‑sector innovation, placing it modestly to the left of global mixed‑market norms on the profit‑innovation versus state‑planning spectrum.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Madagascar’s constitution and a few security‑related laws permit the state to monitor communications for national security, but the country lacks a comprehensive surveillance infrastructure and no evidence of widespread implementation, placing it slightly on the pro‑surveillance side of the global spectrum.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Madagascar maintains democratic institutions but enforces defamation laws and has historically curtailed dissent, leaving citizens with limited practical freedom to criticize the government without repercussions—below the global centrist norm.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Madagascar’s political history of coups and social unrest has prompted the state to adopt measures that restrict certain freedoms in the interest of law and order, yet the country still holds periodic elections and retains some civil liberties; this yields a moderate rightward inclination.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Madagascar’s constitution and electoral system reflect democratic norms, yet the country has struggled with weak institutions and occasional political crises, indicating a moderate tolerance for strong executive action without endorsing authoritarianism.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Madagascar operates a semi‑presidential representative system and has used referendums only sporadically (primarily for constitutional reforms); it does not routinely let the public decide most policy matters. Compared to global norms, this places it below the center, leaning toward limited direct democracy.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Madagascar’s constitution and policing statutes emphasize accountability and proportional use of force, and there is no sustained, nationwide policy that markedly expands police authority beyond what is customary in many democracies. Consequently, the country’s stance on giving police more power to control crime is essentially neutral, with only sporadic calls for tighter policing during crisis periods.",0.0
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Madagascar’s constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and expression, yet its history of crackdowns on protests and the suppression of civil disobedience—especially during the 2002 and 2009 political crises—shows a cautious, partially tolerant stance that aligns with a moderate, center‑pro position on the global scale.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Madagascar operates a semi‑presidential republic with constitutional provisions that assign the state a role in social welfare, security, and national unity. Although the central authority’s capacity is limited and the country has experienced political instability, its institutions and policy history (e.g., state‑run education, health, and public service initiatives) reflect a moderate endorsement that government authority is needed to maintain social cohesion.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Madagascar’s constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and assembly are frequently undermined by government crackdowns on the press, arbitrary arrests, and restrictive emergency measures, putting it below the global average for protecting personal liberties even during crises.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Madagascar’s constitution and defense legislation stipulate that its armed forces are composed entirely of volunteers; there is no law or practice of compulsory military service.  In line with the global norm that a majority of countries do not enforce conscription, Madagascar’s position is contrary to the statement.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Madagascar’s legal framework includes anti‑corruption statutes and a national anti‑corruption agency, yet enforcement is weak, civil society is fragmented, and public mechanisms for swiftly removing or sanctioning leaders are limited. Compared to global standards, the country falls below the neutral point for strict public accountability.",-0.35
