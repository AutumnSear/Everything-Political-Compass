Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Saudi Arabia has consistently expanded the authority of its police and security forces, granting them broad powers to detain, interrogate, and punish suspects under Sharia law; the government views strong policing as essential to counter terrorism and maintain social order, positioning it far more favorably than many liberal democracies that limit police powers.",0.85
