Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Bangladesh enacts a range of labor, consumer, and environmental laws (e.g., Minimum Wage Ordinance, Factories Act, Consumer Protection Act) and runs state‑owned enterprises, indicating a clear pro‑regulation stance, though enforcement is often weak, keeping its position moderate rather than extreme.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Bangladesh uses a progressive tax system and has social safety‑net programs, showing support for redistribution, but its low tax-to‑GDP ratio and modest welfare spending indicate only a moderate commitment compared to many OECD nations.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Bangladesh has pursued economic liberalization and actively promotes private sector growth (e.g., export processing zones, FDI incentives, and privatization of state enterprises), reflecting a belief that private businesses tend to be more efficient than government programs. However, it still maintains substantial state involvement in key industries and public services, indicating a moderate, mixed‑market stance rather than a fully free‑market view.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Bangladesh legally recognizes labor unions and offers limited worker protections, but the government restricts union power through weak collective bargaining rights and enforcement, placing the country moderately pro‑union yet not fully left‑leaning.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Bangladesh runs a mixed economy that combines significant state intervention—through subsidies, state‑owned enterprises, and regulatory controls—with a growing emphasis on liberal trade agreements and private investment. This practical approach suggests a moderate, slightly pro‑free‑market stance rather than a full laissez‑faire position.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Bangladesh runs a broad mix of social safety‑net and poverty‑reduction programmes (cash grants, food subsidies, scholarships, health coverage) while simultaneously promoting micro‑enterprise and self‑employment initiatives; thus it views welfare as a necessary buffer but not an excuse for a lack of personal responsibility, positioning it slightly left of center.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Bangladesh operates a mixed health system with a significant private sector; no national policy mandates replacing private insurance with public healthcare, so it leans slightly against the statement.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Bangladesh has a modestly progressive income tax system with higher brackets for the wealthiest, but overall tax rates and enforcement are low, placing it slightly to the left of center compared to global norms.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Bangladesh has progressively eased some corporate regulations and offers investment incentives, yet it maintains significant state control over key sectors, licensing requirements, and regulatory hurdles—placing it only marginally right of center compared to global norms that favor minimal restrictions.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Bangladesh keeps most essential utilities (electricity, water, rail) under state control while permitting private participation through PPPs; this moderate public‑ownership stance places it slightly left of the global average, though not fully nationalized.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Bangladesh pursues a mixed‑market model that supports private enterprise while using state intervention to curb inequality, treating capitalist growth as a tool rather than a certainty that breeds instability; thus it largely disagrees that capitalism inevitably creates inequality.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Bangladesh’s economy is largely private‑sector driven—especially in apparel, ICT, and manufacturing—yet the state still plays a significant role through development plans, key infrastructure, and social safety nets, positioning the country just right of centre on the scale.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Bangladesh’s legal framework—especially the Digital Security Act, the Anti‑Terrorism Act and related telecom regulations—provides the state with broad monitoring powers that the government routinely justifies on national‑security grounds, reflecting a stance that leans strongly toward accepting surveillance for security purposes.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Bangladesh’s legal framework criminalizes defamation and routinely uses laws such as the Digital Security Act to curb criticism, resulting in a highly restricted environment for free expression.

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Bangladesh has routinely used law‑enforcement and legal measures—such as the Digital Security Act, curfew impositions, and targeted arrests of opposition and civil‑society activists—to maintain order, yet it still conducts regular elections, retains a multi‑party parliamentary system, and preserves a degree of free expression and media coverage. Compared to global norms, this represents a moderate tilt toward prioritizing law and order even at the cost of some freedoms.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,Bangladesh’s political history shows a strong preference for decisive leadership—evidenced by periods of military rule and powerful prime ministers—yet its constitution and regular elections maintain a parliamentary democracy; this balance places it slightly in favor of strong leadership without fully abandoning democratic norms.,0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Bangladesh operates a parliamentary democracy with elected representatives and no regular use of referendums; its constitutional framework and historical practice show little support for direct public decision‑making on most issues, placing it below the global median.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Bangladesh’s recent legal reforms and policy initiatives, such as the 2009 Police Act and the National Action Plan for Crime Prevention, reflect a moderate inclination toward expanding police powers to curb crime, yet documented concerns about police abuse and human‑rights criticism keep the stance from reaching an extreme pro level.",0.35

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Bangladesh has no compulsory military service; enlistment is voluntary and the law does not mandate duty for all citizens. This places the country slightly against the statement, though not strongly opposed.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Bangladesh’s constitution and anti‑corruption laws formally require leaders to be accountable, but in practice enforcement is weak due to political interference, limited press freedom, and low judicial independence, positioning the country below the global average for strict public accountability.",-0.33
