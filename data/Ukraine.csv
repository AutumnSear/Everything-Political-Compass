Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Ukraine has pursued a moderate progressive tax regime and expanded social welfare programs (e.g., child benefits, pensions, and subsidies) to curb inequality, but it stops short of radical wealth redistribution; its stance aligns with many European countries that favor a balanced approach.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Ukraine’s post‑independence reforms and EU‑integration agenda have consistently promoted market liberalization, with the government enacting tax reform, privatizing key state assets (e.g., parts of the steel and energy sectors), and actively seeking foreign investment, signaling a belief that private firms can be more efficient than state programs—though the state still retains control over strategic industries.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Ukraine’s constitution and labor laws guarantee freedom of association and encourage union activity, yet the country’s post‑Soviet reforms and market‑oriented reforms have limited union power; thus Ukraine supports the necessity of unions for worker protection but not to the extent seen in many Western European states.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Ukraine has pursued extensive market reforms since 1991, joined the WTO, and liberalized many sectors, yet it maintains state control in strategic industries (energy, defense) and employs robust regulatory frameworks to combat corruption, reflecting a pragmatic blend of free‑market enthusiasm and prudent state oversight.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Ukraine’s social protection framework blends safety‑net benefits with eligibility conditions and employment incentives—e.g., the 2016 Social Protection Reform Law links benefit receipt to job‑search or training requirements—so officials largely reject the notion that welfare discourages personal responsibility.",-0.3

Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Ukraine is a parliamentary republic that upholds a multi‑party system, rule of law, and free media, and it has repeatedly condemned authoritarian rule—especially after the 2014 Revolution of Dignity and ongoing Russian aggression that seeks to impose a single‑person dictatorship.

Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Ukraine has repeatedly used referendums for major constitutional and policy decisions (e.g., the 2019 constitutional amendment referendum) but maintains a representative parliamentary system for most legislation, indicating a pragmatic, selective support for direct democracy rather than a wholesale shift to referendums.

Compared to global norms—where conscription remains common but increasingly voluntary—Ukraine sits on the pro-conscription side of the spectrum.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Ukraine’s constitution and recent anti‑corruption reforms mandate that ministers and elected officials be subject to judicial review, and the country has created independent bodies such as the National Anti‑Corruption Bureau that can prosecute high‑ranking leaders.
