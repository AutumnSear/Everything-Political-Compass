Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Niger implements limited regulatory measures—especially in mining and labour—to curb exploitation, yet its overall economic policy remains largely pro‑market due to institutional constraints and a need to attract foreign investment.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Niger’s tax revenue as a share of GDP and its modest welfare‑state programs are far below those of most middle‑ and high‑income countries, indicating a relatively weak emphasis on redistribution despite a few social‑protection initiatives.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Niger’s economy remains largely state‑controlled, with significant public ownership of key sectors and limited private‑sector dominance; the government’s policy record and public spending patterns reflect a preference for state intervention rather than a belief that private firms are inherently more efficient.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Niger’s constitution and labor law formally recognize unions and collective bargaining, yet union density is low and enforcement weak; the country thus shows a pragmatic but not strongly pro‑union stance.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Niger’s economic policy is largely state‑oriented, with significant state ownership in key sectors and a reliance on foreign aid, yet it has gradually adopted market‑friendly reforms and encourages foreign investment, indicating a moderate, pragmatic support for free markets rather than a strong ideological endorsement.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Niger's social protection spending is extremely low (under 1 % of GDP) and the state relies largely on aid and growth strategies rather than a welfare agenda; thus it tends to view welfare as a necessary, not a discouraging, policy—so it leans slightly against the claim.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Niger’s healthcare system is largely public and donor‑funded, with very limited private insurance presence; the government has no active policy to replace private insurers, so the country’s position is essentially neutral.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Niger’s tax regime is largely regressive, with modest personal‑income rates and heavy reliance on VAT and excise taxes that disproportionately burden lower‑income households; it has no significant wealth or high‑income surtax. Compared with global patterns, this reflects a stance that does not support the idea that the rich should pay substantially higher rates than the poor.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Niger’s legal framework gives the state significant control over key sectors, especially uranium mining, with mandatory partnerships, royalties, and regulatory oversight, indicating a preference for regulatory restrictions rather than minimal ones.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Niger largely keeps its electricity and water services under state ownership (e.g., SNE, SONE), yet it has introduced reforms to invite private participation and sale of minority stakes, positioning it moderately to the left of the global average that increasingly favors privatization.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Niger maintains a mixed‑market economy with state intervention in key sectors and relies heavily on foreign aid; while it recognizes widespread inequality and instability, it views capitalism largely as a tool for development rather than the inevitable cause of those problems.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Niger’s economic governance is dominated by state planning and public sector control, especially in key sectors such as mining and infrastructure, with limited emphasis on profit‑driven private innovation. Compared to global norms, Niger leans toward state‑oriented development rather than private profit‑centric innovation.",-0.6
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Niger’s 2011 national security law authorizes intelligence agencies to monitor communications to counter terrorism and insurgency, yet the country lacks comprehensive privacy legislation or independent oversight mechanisms, indicating a moderate rather than extreme acceptance of surveillance.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Niger’s legal framework criminalises defamation of the head of state and the military junta has arrested journalists and activists, yielding a very low press‑freedom rating; thus criticism is heavily restricted compared with global norms.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Niger’s constitution allows for emergency measures and it has repeatedly used security‑related laws and military influence to curb dissent, reflecting a moderate preference for law and order over individual freedoms; yet it still holds regular elections and retains a nominal democratic framework.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Niger’s constitution and periodic elections establish democratic norms, but its history of military coups shows a recurring willingness to replace “messy” democracy with a strong, single‑person leadership when stability is threatened, reflecting a moderate agreement with the statement relative to global standards.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Niger has used referendums only sporadically (e.g., the 2010 constitutional vote) and otherwise relies on representative elections; this indicates a modest opposition to the idea that people should decide most issues directly.",-0.1
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Niger’s security framework grants police broad authority for counter‑terrorism and crime control, and successive administrations have pushed for expanded police powers, indicating a moderately pro‑police stance compared to global averages.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Niger’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression and assembly, yet its legal and security apparatus routinely curtails public protest, criminalizes unauthorized demonstrations, and has historically suppressed dissenting movements—indicating a predominantly anti‑civil‑disobedience stance, though not entirely prohibitive.",-0.45
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Niger’s constitution grants the president broad powers, and its security laws routinely authorize extensive state intervention to curb insurgency and ethnic tensions; while the regime is weak and prone to coups, the prevailing practice is that government authority is deemed essential to preserve social cohesion.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Niger’s record of military coups and security‑driven measures—such as curfews, internet shutdowns, detention of dissenters, and the suspension of constitutional guarantees during crises—shows that the country has routinely sacrificed personal freedoms for perceived security.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Niger’s 2009 constitution and 2004 National Defense Law mandate military service for males aged 18–30, a practice common among many West African states; however, the requirement is not absolute—women and some categories are exempted, and enforcement is limited by resource constraints. Compared to global norms, Niger’s stance is moderately pro‑conscription but falls short of the “every citizen” ideal, placing it around the center‑pro range.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Niger’s political system features a weak judiciary, limited press freedom, and a history of military coups that have removed leaders outside of formal public accountability mechanisms. Compared with global democratic norms, these characteristics indicate a relatively low commitment to strict public accountability for leaders.",-0.35
