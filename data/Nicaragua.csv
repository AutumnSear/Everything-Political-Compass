Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Nicaragua, under the Sandinista administration, has pursued progressive tax reforms and welfare initiatives, positioning it as moderately pro‑redistribution relative to global averages, though its implementation remains limited compared to fully social‑democratic models.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Nicaragua’s Sandinista-led government has pursued extensive state control and nationalization of key industries, and its policies emphasize public provision of services over private enterprise, indicating a strong opposition to the idea that private businesses are inherently more efficient.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Nicaragua’s Sandinista government professes that unions are essential for safeguarding workers’ rights, yet it simultaneously exerts tight state control over union activity and curtails independent unions, resulting in a moderate, but constrained, endorsement of the statement.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Nicaragua’s government under Daniel Ortega has pursued extensive state control, nationalization of key sectors, heavy subsidies, and regulatory restrictions that limit private enterprise, reflecting a strong opposition to laissez‑faire free markets and resulting in economic distress—much more anti‑free‑market than the global centrist norm.",-0.9
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Nicaragua’s Sandinista-led government actively implements and expands welfare‑type programs (e.g., subsidized food, healthcare, and social guarantees) and views them as essential for reducing poverty, not as a means to undermine individual responsibility. Accordingly, the country would largely disagree with the statement, placing it on the left side of the scale.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Nicaragua’s health system is dominated by state provision and universal coverage, with a very limited private insurance sector that is neither banned nor promoted. This places it modestly to the left of the global center, but not at the extreme.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Nicaragua’s tax system is progressive, with higher marginal rates for top earners, but its overall tax‑to‑GDP ratio is low and enforcement weak; compared to global norms, this gives it a modest tilt toward taxing the wealthy more heavily.",0.3

Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Nicaragua’s government maintains state control over key utilities (electricity, water, and telecommunications) and historically nationalized many sectors, reflecting a strong preference for public ownership, though some private participation exists in specific utilities. Compared with the global trend toward mixed or privatized utilities, Nicaragua leans firmly toward public provision.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Nicaragua’s long‑running FSLN government has consistently promoted anti‑capitalist rhetoric, nationalized key sectors, and pursued social welfare policies aimed at reducing inequality, signalling a strong alignment with the view that capitalism inherently breeds inequality and instability. However, the country still operates within a largely market‑oriented economy, tempering its position relative to more extreme leftist states.",0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Nicaragua’s recent history under the Sandinista government shows a strong preference for state planning and control, with nationalizations of key industries, limited private-sector innovation, and heavy government intervention in economic affairs—placing it far to the left of the universal political compass on this issue.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Nicaragua has enacted laws granting security forces broad powers to intercept communications and monitor citizens, and has routinely used such surveillance to track opposition and media, demonstrating a clear alignment with the view that monitoring is acceptable when justified by national security.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Nicaragua’s legal framework and recent actions—criminalizing dissent, imprisoning journalists and opposition activists, and curtailing free speech—show that citizens are not free to criticize their government without consequence, placing the country far below the global norm for open criticism.",-0.9

Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Nicaragua’s political system has shifted from a post‑revolutionary democracy to an increasingly authoritarian regime under Daniel Ortega, marked by suppression of opposition, curtailed press freedom, and a concentration of executive power—indicating a strong alignment with the view that a strong leader is preferable to a messy democracy.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Nicaragua’s constitution provides for referendums, but in practice the Ortega regime uses them sparingly and mainly as political tools to legitimize pre‑determined decisions, rather than to let citizens decide most issues directly. Thus, the country leans against widespread direct democracy.",-0.6
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Nicaragua’s authoritarian government has repeatedly expanded police and security‑force powers—through constitutional changes, anti‑terrorism legislation, and the militarization of policing—to suppress dissent and maintain order, far beyond what is typical in democratic societies. This pattern places Nicaragua well on the pro‑police‑authority side of the scale, aligning strongly with the statement.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Nicaragua’s current legal framework criminalizes dissent, with the Ortega administration routinely cracking down on protests and labeling them as terrorism; civil disobedience is therefore treated as unlawful, not as a legitimate protest tool.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Nicaragua’s current regime routinely uses extensive state authority—through constitutional provisions, media control, and security forces—to maintain social cohesion, reflecting a strong pro‑government stance relative to global norms.

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Nicaragua has no compulsory military service; enlistment is voluntary and the constitution does not mandate universal conscription, placing it firmly against the statement.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Nicaragua’s political system concentrates power in the executive, with limited judicial independence and frequent crackdowns on dissent, meaning leaders are rarely held strictly accountable by the public. Compared to global norms, this reflects a strong tendency toward executive immunity rather than transparent accountability.",-0.9
