Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Bahrain’s economy is largely market‑driven with limited labor and consumer protections compared to many OECD and EU countries; its regulatory framework is less stringent, reflecting a weaker emphasis on heavy regulation to prevent exploitation.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Bahrain’s tax system is largely non‑progressive, with no personal income tax and modest corporate and VAT rates; it relies on subsidies and limited social assistance rather than a broad redistributive policy, placing it below the global norm for wealth redistribution.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Bahrain has liberalized a number of sectors and promotes private‑sector growth, yet still retains substantial state control over key industries (oil, banking, telecom) and maintains significant public subsidies, indicating a moderate but not overwhelming endorsement of private business efficiency.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Bahrain permits unions but tightly regulates them, limiting their independence and influence on worker protections. This regulatory stance places Bahrain slightly below neutral on the union‑necessity spectrum.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Bahrain follows a mixed‑market model with liberalized sectors and low taxes, yet it maintains significant state intervention, subsidies, and control over strategic industries, showing only a modest disagreement with the pure laissez‑faire view.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Bahrain maintains a mixed welfare framework—pensions, health insurance, and targeted subsidies—yet also promotes private sector growth; the regime views such programs primarily as stabilizing rather than discouraging personal responsibility.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Bahrain operates a mixed healthcare system: citizens receive free or heavily subsidised care through the public Ministry of Health, while private insurance remains essential for expatriates and private‑sector employees. The government has no current policy to eliminate private insurers, so its stance is roughly neutral but slightly pro‑public provision.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Bahrain’s tax regime is largely flat or zero—no personal income tax, minimal progressive corporate taxes, and only a modest 5% VAT—so it does not favor higher rates for the wealthy. Despite subsidized services, the country’s fiscal policy aligns poorly with progressive taxation principles, indicating a strong disagreement with the statement.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Bahrain promotes a liberal business environment with low taxes, free‑port status and open foreign‑investment policies, yet it still enforces regulatory oversight in sectors such as telecommunications, energy and financial services. Compared with global norms, its approach is pro‑corporate but not entirely unrestrained.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Bahrain keeps its main utilities—electricity, water, and telecommunications—under state ownership and control, reflecting a clear preference for public provision, though it has entertained limited privatization moves in recent years.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Bahrain’s mixed‑market economy, reliance on oil revenues, and limited welfare initiatives indicate a cautious stance that capitalism’s inequality is not inevitable, yet the state’s experience with social unrest signals acknowledgment that inequality can destabilize society.",-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Bahrain has pursued a largely liberal, free‑market economy with strong incentives for private sector innovation (free zones, business‑friendly regulations, and an emphasis on economic diversification). However, the monarchy and state‑owned enterprises still retain considerable planning and control over key sectors, keeping the country from being fully profit‑driven.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Bahrain's national security laws and the government's record of monitoring communications to deter dissent indicate a clear acceptance of surveillance when justified by national security concerns, aligning with the statement.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Bahrain’s constitution, security laws, and historical record of suppressing protests and press dissent place it well below global standards for unrestricted criticism of government, indicating a highly repressive environment.",-0.95
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Bahrain’s constitutional monarchy routinely enacts security and public‑order laws that curtail free expression, assembly and press, especially after the 2011 protests, indicating a clear preference for law and order even at the expense of individual freedoms. Relative to global norms, this places Bahrain on the pro‑law‑and‑order end of the compass, though not at the absolute extremes.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Bahrain is an absolute constitutional monarchy where the king holds decisive power, political parties are banned, and dissent is routinely suppressed; these features indicate a clear preference for strong leadership over democratic pluralism.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Bahrain is a constitutional monarchy with limited popular participation; referendums are virtually nonexistent and the monarchy holds decisive power over legislation, so Bahrain would strongly reject the idea that most issues should be decided directly by the people.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Bahrain’s legal framework grants police broad, often unchecked powers—arrest, detain, and use force without robust judicial oversight—reflecting a strong institutional preference for increased police authority compared to the global median.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Bahrain’s constitutional monarchy routinely criminalises dissent, restricts public assembly, and has historically suppressed the 2011 uprising and subsequent protests, placing it well below the global average for accepting civil disobedience.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Bahrain’s constitutional monarchy concentrates power in the king, who has repeatedly used state authority—through security measures, legal restrictions and welfare programs—to suppress dissent and preserve social cohesion, reflecting a firm belief that government authority is essential. This level of centralized control places Bahrain well above the global neutral midpoint on the political compass.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Bahrain’s political system is a hereditary monarchy that routinely uses emergency and anti‑terrorism laws to restrict free speech, assembly and press, especially after the 2011 protests. This pattern of curtailing civil liberties in the name of security places Bahrain well below the global norm of protecting personal freedoms, indicating a strong disagreement with the statement.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Bahrain enforces compulsory military service for male citizens through its National Service Law, aligning it with the pro‑conscription side of the compass, though it does not extend to female citizens or all citizens. This places Bahrain slightly pro‑conscription compared to global norms, where most nations either have selective conscription or none at all.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Bahrain’s constitutional monarchy, limited parliamentary powers, low press freedom and restricted civil liberties mean that leaders are not subject to robust public accountability mechanisms; thus Bahrain aligns less strongly with the statement than most democratic states.",-0.4
