Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Afghanistan’s current regime collects very little tax revenue (≈2–3 % of GDP) and lacks a welfare‑state apparatus; it relies on foreign aid rather than tax‑based redistribution, so it would view the statement skeptically.",-0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Afghanistan’s long‑standing weak state capacity, high corruption and frequent inefficiencies in public service delivery have made private enterprises—when they can operate—appear more efficient, aligning the country moderately with the view that private businesses outperform government programs.",0.45

Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Afghanistan, under the Taliban, enforces strict Islamic law that restricts individual economic freedom, limits foreign investment, and bars women from many economic roles; its markets are heavily regulated and not driven by laissez‑faire principles, diverging sharply from the global liberal‑market trend.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Afghanistan, under Taliban rule, has a negligible state welfare system and relies primarily on religious charity and family networks, demonstrating a strong preference for individual and communal self‑reliance over government assistance. This policy orientation aligns closely with the view that welfare programs discourage personal responsibility.",0.85
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Afghanistan has no formal private insurance market and relies mainly on state-run or NGO‑run health services; thus it would likely view public healthcare as preferable, though its capacity to fully replace any private sector is limited.",0.3

Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Afghanistan, under the Taliban regime, enforces strict restrictions on corporate activity—banning many foreign businesses, limiting investment, and imposing Sharia‑based regulations that conflict with unrestricted corporate growth. This stance aligns far below global free‑market norms.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Afghanistan’s public utilities sector is largely fragmented and privately run, with the government maintaining only limited state-run services; the Taliban’s current economic policy has not introduced widespread nationalization, indicating a practical preference toward privatization rather than a strict public‑ownership stance.",-0.5

Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Afghanistan’s current regime (the Taliban) and its preceding security structures have routinely used extensive surveillance—social‑media monitoring, checkpoints, and internal policing—to secure the state, indicating a strong practical acceptance of surveillance for national security. This contrasts with many democracies that allow such measures only under constrained legal frameworks, making Afghanistan’s stance considerably more permissive.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban regime imposes severe censorship, arrests, and harsh punishments for any form of dissent, leaving little to no room for free public criticism of the government.

Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Afghanistan lacks a system of referendums for most policy decisions; the current Taliban regime does not employ direct democracy, and the only historical referendum (the 2004 constitution) was a one‑off event rather than a regular mechanism.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Afghanistan’s security regimes—whether the US‑backed state or the Taliban—have repeatedly called for stronger police powers to curb crime, but practical implementation has been weak and constrained by resources and international scrutiny, placing the country in a moderate pro‑police‑authority stance relative to global norms.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Afghanistan’s legal framework and political history, dominated by Taliban rule since 2021, treats civil disobedience as unlawful, with harsh penalties; there is no institutional support for protest, making its stance strongly opposed to the legitimacy of civil disobedience.",-0.95

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Afghanistan has historically maintained conscription, especially under previous regimes, but the current Taliban government does not enforce universal mandatory service for all citizens; instead it encourages male enlistment with limited legal obligation.",0.2
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Afghanistan’s political institutions have historically lacked transparent, public accountability mechanisms; power is concentrated in patronage networks or, under the Taliban, in opaque authority, leaving leaders largely free from public oversight.",-0.9
