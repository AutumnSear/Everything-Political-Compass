Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Romania adopts EU‑mandated regulatory frameworks (labour, consumer, environmental) but enforcement is uneven and the state largely maintains a market‑oriented stance, resulting in a moderate pro‑regulation position.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Romania operates a flat 10 % personal‑income tax and its social‑welfare spending is below the EU average, indicating only modest support for redistributive taxation as a tool to curb inequality. The country’s actual fiscal policy reflects a neutral to weak endorsement of the statement.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Romania, having transitioned from a centrally‑planned system to a mixed market economy, has repeatedly privatized state‑owned enterprises and promotes private‑sector growth, indicating a moderate pro‑private stance. However, its public sector remains sizable (public expenditure ~35 % of GDP) and essential services are largely state‑run, so its position is not strongly in favor of full privatization.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Romania enforces comprehensive labor laws guaranteeing collective bargaining and strike rights, placing it within the pro‑union range of EU member states, though its union density and coverage rates lag behind the most union‑strong democracies. This legal backing, coupled with active union participation in many sectors, indicates a moderately pro stance.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Romania has embraced market reforms and liberalization since the 1990s, yet EU membership and domestic policies still impose substantial regulation and state participation in key sectors, making its stance only moderately supportive of unregulated free markets.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Romania’s modest welfare system, characterized by conditional benefits and a strong emphasis on employment and self‑reliance, suggests a mild belief that excessive welfare can dampen work incentives, though the state still provides essential social protection.",0.15
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Romania operates a universal public health insurance system that covers all citizens, but it does not prohibit or eliminate private insurers; the government’s reforms focus on strengthening public coverage rather than replacing private insurance entirely.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Romania’s tax system relies on a flat 10 % personal income tax with no progressive brackets, meaning the wealthy do not pay a higher marginal rate than the poor. Relative to global norms, this places Romania on the right‑leaning side of the progressive‑tax dimension, leading to a moderately negative score.",-0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Romania’s EU membership and recent liberal‑market reforms show a moderate pro‑growth stance, but persistent bureaucratic hurdles, state‑owned enterprises in key sectors, and regulatory compliance (e.g., competition law, tax codes) keep its environment more restrictive than highly deregulated economies. Thus, its approach is only slightly above the global median for minimal restrictions.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Romania has progressively privatized many essential utilities (telecom, electricity, gas) in line with EU liberalization, but retains key public assets such as the national grid and some municipal water services, reflecting a mixed approach that leans modestly toward public ownership.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Romania’s mixed-market economy acknowledges capitalism’s role in generating growth, yet it also recognizes the potential for inequality and social unrest; state interventions—such as universal healthcare, social assistance, and labor protections—are employed to mitigate these effects, resulting in a moderate agreement with the statement.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Romania operates a mixed‑market economy that strongly encourages private, profit‑driven innovation through incentives, tax breaks, and EU‑funded research programmes, while still maintaining state‑led planning in key sectors such as infrastructure and energy. This balances support for the private sector with continued state involvement, placing Romania slightly on the profit‑driven side of the universal compass.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Romania permits surveillance for national‑security purposes under legal frameworks that require judicial authorization and parliamentary oversight, placing it in the mid‑range of acceptance compared to other EU states. Its position is moderate‑pro, reflecting a willingness to use monitoring when justified by security concerns while still upholding data‑protection principles.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Romania's constitution guarantees freedom of expression, but its penal code imposes criminal and civil penalties for defamation and political insults; press‑freedom indices rank it lower than many EU peers, indicating some constraints on unfettered criticism. Thus, while criticism is legally possible, it carries measurable risks.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Romania’s democratic constitution and EU commitments preserve broad civil liberties, yet recent security laws and targeted restrictions on protest activity indicate a modest prioritization of law and order. Compared to global norms, the country lies only slightly to the right of the neutral line, balancing enforcement with fundamental freedoms.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Romania’s post‑Communist transition to a parliamentary republic, EU membership, and robust institutions of checks and balances demonstrate a clear preference for democratic governance over an autocratic “strong leader,” yielding a negative score.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Romania’s constitution allows for referendums, yet they have been used infrequently and only for a handful of major issues; decision‑making is primarily handled by elected representatives, placing the country on the representative‑democracy side of the scale.",-0.4
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Romania generally supports moderate strengthening of police powers for crime control—evidenced by recent reforms of the Criminal Procedure Code and EU‑aligned anti‑corruption measures—but it also maintains strong legal safeguards and human‑rights commitments, placing it modestly on the pro‑police‑authority side of the global spectrum.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Romania’s constitution and EU membership protect freedom of assembly and expression, and its courts have repeatedly upheld the legitimacy of peaceful protests, yet the state frequently imposes strict permitting requirements and police enforcement that can constrain civil disobedience. This places Romania modestly on the pro‑civil disobedience side, roughly aligned with mainstream democratic norms.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Romania’s post‑Communist democratic system blends significant state authority—required by its constitution and EU commitments—to ensure social cohesion with robust market‑oriented policies, resulting in a moderate pro‑government stance.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Romania’s constitution and EU membership strongly protect personal freedoms, yet the country has enacted emergency restrictions—most notably during the COVID‑19 pandemic and for security purposes—demonstrating a pragmatic, slightly pro‑freedom stance relative to global averages.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Romania abolished mandatory conscription in 2005 and now maintains a volunteer‑based professional military, positioning it firmly against compulsory service in line with many EU peers.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Romania enshrines formal accountability mechanisms—constitutional checks, a functioning anti‑corruption directorate, and parliamentary no‑confidence motions—but frequent political interference, weak enforcement of transparency laws, and a comparatively high corruption index mean the public’s hold on leaders is moderate rather than strict.",0.2
