Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Hungary’s governing coalition has historically reduced labor protections and weakened collective bargaining, while selectively tightening state control in strategic sectors; this pattern indicates a preference for limited, politically motivated regulation rather than broad, exploitation‑prevention measures.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Hungary operates a flat 15% personal income tax and relatively low public social‑expenditure (≈11 % of GDP, below the EU average), reflecting a weaker commitment to wealth redistribution compared to many European welfare states.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Hungary’s Fidesz-led government supports a market‑oriented economy and frequently cites private sector dynamism, yet it also maintains substantial state ownership and intervention in key industries, reflecting a moderate pro‑private stance that acknowledges state roles when needed.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Hungary’s recent labor reforms have weakened union representation and collective bargaining rights, indicating that the government does not view unions as essential for protecting workers’ rights. This places Hungary slightly below neutral on the universal political compass scale.",-0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Hungary’s recent policy trajectory—marked by state‑directed interventions in media, telecom, banking, and targeted subsidies for domestic firms—indicates a belief that free markets alone are insufficient, diverging from the statement’s optimistic laissez‑faire view. While the country remains a member of the EU single market, its interventions and protectionist measures signal a moderate disagreement with the claim that unregulated markets universally yield long‑term benefits.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Hungary has systematically reduced and tightened its welfare programs—cutting unemployment benefits, tightening eligibility, raising retirement age—while maintaining a public health system, placing it slightly to the right of global averages that favor broader social safety nets.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Hungary maintains a mixed healthcare system where private health insurance continues to operate alongside public coverage; recent reforms have strengthened public provision but not abolished the private sector, indicating a moderate opposition to fully public replacement.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Hungary’s tax system is predominantly flat (15 % personal income tax, 9 % corporate tax) with only a modest 25 % marginal rate for very high incomes; compared to global standards, it does not strongly favor significantly higher rates for the rich.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Hungary pursues pro‑growth policies such as low corporate tax rates and incentives for investment, but the government also exerts significant state influence over key sectors (energy, telecommunications, and national security) and implements regulatory controls that restrict unrestricted corporate freedom.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Hungary’s current administration has largely pursued nationalization and state control of key utilities such as railways and the electricity grid, while only partially privatizing certain distribution services. This policy orientation aligns strongly with the view that essential services should remain public, though not absolute.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Hungary’s Fidesz‑Orbán administration acknowledges that free‑market capitalism can fuel inequality and social unrest, yet it continues to rely on a mixed‑economy model with private enterprise and market‑driven growth. Consequently, Hungary leans modestly toward agreeing that capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability, but it stops short of endorsing a complete abolition of the system.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Hungary’s current governance under Fidesz emphasizes substantial state intervention—especially in strategic sectors, media, and innovation policy—while limiting private sector autonomy and foreign investment, reflecting a preference for state planning over pure profit‑driven innovation. Compared to global norms where mixed‑market economies allow significant private innovation, Hungary leans slightly left of center.",-0.35
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Hungary has repeatedly enacted and expanded legal provisions that allow law‑enforcement agencies to conduct surveillance in the name of national security (e.g., the 2020 “Protection of the State” law and the 2019 telecommunications monitoring law). While it has not adopted an all‑encompassing constant‑monitoring regime, its legislative and practical record shows a clear willingness to accept surveillance when justified by security concerns, aligning it moderately with the statement.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Hungary has enacted laws that criminalise or penalise criticism of the government—such as harsher defamation statutes, state control over media and universities, and a history of lawsuits against dissenters—placing it well below global norms that protect free expression.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Hungary has consistently adopted laws and policies that prioritize law‑and‑order—restricting press freedom, curbing NGO activity, and weakening judicial independence—reflecting a strong authoritarian tilt while still maintaining some democratic institutions.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Hungary has consolidated executive power under Viktor Orbán, amended its constitution, tightened control over media and NGOs, and weakened judicial independence—behaviors that favor a strong, centralized leader over a pluralistic, messy democracy.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Hungary operates mainly as a representative democracy that uses referendums sparingly for specific constitutional or social matters; it does not routinely allow citizens to decide on most issues directly, placing it somewhat anti‑proposition.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Hungary’s Fidesz-led government has consistently expanded police powers through legislative reforms, increased budgets, and stricter enforcement measures, placing it well above the global median for police authority. Compared to most EU members that maintain a balance between law‑enforcement powers and civil liberties, Hungary’s policies lean strongly toward enhanced police control, reflecting a high‑authority stance.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Hungary’s laws on public order and frequent police crackdowns on anti‑government demonstrations reveal a low tolerance for civil disobedience, diverging from the broader democratic norm that views it as a legitimate protest tool. The government’s use of restrictive assembly statutes and punitive actions places its stance firmly on the anti side of the compass.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Hungary’s current government routinely expands state authority—through tightened media control, anti‑immigration laws, and nationalist rhetoric—to preserve perceived social cohesion, a stance far more interventionist than most democratic states, which balance government oversight with civil liberties.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Hungary’s government has repeatedly used crisis narratives to justify limits on media, civil society, and individual movement—evidenced by restrictive legislation and COVID‑19 emergency measures—so its stance diverges sharply from the view that personal freedoms should never be compromised. Compared to global norms, Hungary scores on the anti‑freedom side.",-0.88
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Hungary historically had conscription but has since shifted to a volunteer military, mirroring the stance of most European democracies that oppose mandatory service.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Hungary’s constitutional reforms, judiciary changes, and tightening of media control have concentrated power and weakened independent checks, reducing public accountability compared to global norms.",-0.7
