Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Laos exercises strong state control over strategic industries (e.g., mining, energy) and enacts formal regulations aimed at protecting national interests, yet enforcement is often weak and many private sectors remain lightly regulated, placing it moderately to the left of the spectrum.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Laos, as a single‑party socialist republic, formally endorses reducing inequality through state intervention, but its tax‑based redistribution mechanisms are modest—tax revenue is only about 12–14 % of GDP, and social spending is limited compared to typical welfare states. Compared to global norms, Laos leans left on the statement but less strongly than more developed socialist or social‑democratic countries.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Laos has pursued market‑oriented reforms and encourages private investment, indicating a pragmatic view that private firms can be more efficient than state programmes. However, the state still controls a majority of key sectors and maintains a strong socialist orientation, so the country only modestly supports the claim.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Laos has a single, state‑controlled union (the Lao Federation of Trade Unions) and its Labor Code formally recognizes unions as a means to safeguard worker rights, yet real independence is minimal; thus Laos is moderately supportive of unions but not fully autonomous, placing it modestly pro on the scale.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Although Laos has introduced market reforms and seen economic gains, its political system retains strong state control over key sectors, limited property rights, and a regulatory environment that contradicts the idea of laissez‑faire. Hence Laos would likely moderately disagree with the statement.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Laos operates a state‑run welfare system that provides free education, health care and basic social security, reflecting a strong left‑leaning stance; the government thus likely disagrees that such programs discourage individual responsibility.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Laos operates a predominantly state‑run health system, with the Social Health Insurance scheme covering the entire population; private insurance companies are virtually absent, and government policy explicitly seeks to replace any private‑insurance model with universal public coverage.",0.85
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Laos implements a flat 5% personal income tax and a 25% corporate tax, lacking progressive tax brackets that favor higher rates on the wealthy, unlike many global peers; therefore it largely disagrees with the statement.",-0.65
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Laos retains substantial state oversight and regulation over corporations—particularly in strategic sectors—and its economic reforms, though market‑oriented, still impose many restrictions and state ownership. Compared to global norms, Laos therefore leans toward a more regulated, left‑leaning stance rather than advocating minimal restrictions.",-0.3

Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,Laos is a one‑party socialist republic that pursues a state‑controlled economy and publicly condemns capitalism as a source of inequality and instability; its policies and ideology thus strongly endorse the statement.,0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Laos is a one‑party socialist republic that heavily prioritizes state planning, especially in strategic sectors, and views profit‑driven innovation as complementary rather than superior. Its mixed‑market reforms are implemented within a strong central planning framework, reflecting a clear preference for state‑guided development over pure market innovation.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Laos routinely employs extensive monitoring of communications and media under its one‑party state security framework, justifying it as necessary for national security; this places it above neutral on the surveillance axis.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Laos is a one‑party socialist republic whose constitution nominally guarantees freedom of speech but is tightly constrained by laws that criminalize dissent, restrict media, and punish public criticism of the government. Compared with global norms that largely protect open criticism, Laos’ legal and practical environment strongly discourages it.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Laos is a single‑party socialist republic where the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party tightly controls the state, media, and political expression; civil liberties are routinely restricted to maintain public order, placing it firmly in the pro‑law‑and‑order camp.",0.95
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,Laos is a one‑party socialist republic where the Lao People's Revolutionary Party concentrates power in a single leader and there is no democratic pluralism; thus its system aligns strongly with the view that a strong leader is preferable to a messy democracy.,0.9
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Laos is a one‑party socialist republic with a heavily controlled political system; referendums are rare, usually limited to constitution‑amendment proposals overseen by the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party, making it far less supportive of direct citizen decision‑making than most democracies.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Laos’ legal framework and single‑party political system grant the police extensive powers for maintaining public order, and the state’s recent laws and security measures reinforce a strong belief in expanding police authority to control crime.",0.75

Compared to global norms, Laos' willingness to curtail personal freedoms places it near the extreme anti‑freedom end of the scale.",-0.95
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Laos has enacted a law requiring all citizens (primarily males 20‑25 years old, with a short period for women) to perform mandatory military service, but the program is largely voluntary and poorly enforced, placing the country slightly on the pro‑conscription side of the global spectrum.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Laos operates as a single‑party communist state with limited mechanisms for public accountability; leaders enjoy broad immunity, the press is tightly controlled, and there is no independent judiciary or public oversight, making the statement largely inconsistent with its political reality.",-0.9
