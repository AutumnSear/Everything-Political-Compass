Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Brazil’s constitution and policy framework emphasize progressive taxation and social welfare programs—such as Bolsa Família and a progressive income‑tax system—to curb inequality, showing a clear alignment with the statement.

Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Brazil’s 1988 Constitution and the Consolidation of Labor Laws grant legal recognition and significant influence to labor unions, and historically unions have shaped major labor reforms and worker protections; however, recent reforms (e.g., 2017) and a decline in union membership have moderated that influence, making Brazil moderately pro‑union on the global scale.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Brazil’s mixed‑market system—combining liberal trade and private enterprise with significant state intervention, regulatory oversight, and social‑safety‑net policies—suggests it does not fully endorse the claim that free markets alone benefit everyone, and it typically views some regulation as necessary to mitigate inequality.",-0.25

Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Brazil employs a progressive income tax (top rate 27.5%) and supports social welfare programs, reflecting a moderate agreement with the idea that the wealthy should pay higher taxes.

Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Brazil operates a mixed economy with significant private innovation (fintech, agribusiness, tech startups) while still maintaining substantial state planning and public investment in research and infrastructure.

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Brazil’s constitution and international commitments strongly protect individual rights, yet the country routinely adopts law‑and‑order measures—such as expanded police powers and public‑security legislation—that can curb certain freedoms. This balances a democratic framework with a pragmatic emphasis on security.",0.25

Compared with global peers, Brazil leans moderately pro‑freedom but exhibits significant deviations that prevent it from scoring as strongly as more liberal democracies.",0.28
