Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Brazil historically pursues a mixed approach, maintaining strong regulatory oversight in strategic sectors such as energy, agriculture, and environmental protection, while also implementing reforms to reduce bureaucratic red tape in manufacturing and finance; thus it views heavy regulation as a moderate tool to prevent exploitation but balances it with market incentives.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Brazil has long pursued progressive taxation and extensive social programs (e.g., Bolsa Família, tax rates up to 27.5%) to curb inequality, reflecting a clear pro‑redistribution stance though not as extreme as the most leftist regimes.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Brazil’s policy history reflects a mixed economy—privatization reforms in the 1990s were followed by a resurgence of state‑run enterprises under Lula, who has emphasized large social programs and strategic public ownership. This balance indicates a moderate skepticism that private businesses are uniformly more efficient than government programs.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Brazil’s constitution guarantees collective bargaining and historically high union density (peaking at ~30% in 2000), but the 2017 labor reform weakened union power by removing mandatory union fees; thus, compared to many global peers with declining union influence, Brazil remains moderately pro‑union.",0.48

Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Brazil’s universal public health system (SUS) is a cornerstone of its social policy, and the government has repeatedly expanded and strengthened it, yet private health insurance remains a significant and legally protected sector; thus Brazil supports a robust public system but is not in favor of abolishing private insurers entirely.",0.55

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Brazil upholds a constitutional framework that balances public security with civil liberties, resisting extreme restrictions on freedoms while supporting law‑and‑order measures; its democratic institutions and active civil society keep any shift toward authoritarianism in check.",0.18
