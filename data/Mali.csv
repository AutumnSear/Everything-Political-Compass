Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Mali has enacted regulatory laws—especially in mining, labor, and trade—but enforcement is often weak, so the country leans modestly toward regulation rather than implementing heavy industry controls.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Mali's tax burden is under 5 % of GDP and largely regressive, with limited progressive levies or robust social‑welfare programs; the government prioritizes development aid over domestic wealth redistribution, placing it on the right side of the statement.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Mali has pursued structural reforms to boost private sector participation and acknowledges that many state‑run programs suffer from inefficiency and corruption; however, the government still plays a major role in key industries, reflecting a moderate but slightly pro‑private orientation.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Mali’s constitution and ratified ILO conventions protect the right to form and join trade unions, and the country hosts an active union movement that has historically engaged in collective bargaining. However, political instability, limited enforcement of labor laws, and occasional state suppression of union activity mean that Mali would view unions as necessary but only in a moderately pro‑union stance rather than a strongly left‑leaning one.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Mali’s economic history shows substantial state intervention—price controls on cotton, state‑owned mining and telecom firms, and heavy reliance on public spending and subsidies—yet it also engages in selective liberalization to attract foreign investment. Compared with global norms, Mali leans toward a modestly anti‑free‑market stance, seeing market liberalization as insufficient alone to lift widespread poverty.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Mali has a minimal welfare infrastructure and largely relies on donor aid, reflecting a pragmatic stance that places limited emphasis on broad social programs; this suggests a moderate alignment with the view that welfare can reduce individual responsibility, though the country does not actively pursue a strongly anti‑welfare ideology.",0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Mali’s public healthcare sector is under-resourced and largely supplemented by limited private providers, but the government has not pursued a comprehensive shift to replace private insurance with a fully public system; it maintains a mixed‑market approach.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Mali’s personal income tax is marginally progressive (top rate 15 % versus flatter regimes elsewhere) but overall tax revenue is low and heavily reliant on regressive indirect taxes, so it does not strongly endorse high progressive rates for the wealthy.",-0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,Mali’s economic policy mixes market incentives with regulatory oversight; the state encourages foreign corporations but maintains significant restrictions—particularly in mining and corporate governance—placing the country modestly to the left of a purely free‑market stance.,-0.15
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Mali predominantly keeps essential utilities—electricity, water, and core telecommunications—under state control, allowing only limited private participation, which places it moderately pro‑public relative to global mixed‑market norms.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Mali’s governance is a mixed‑economy model that employs state‑led development programs while also encouraging private sector participation; it has not embraced a doctrinaire view that capitalism inevitably breeds inequality, so its position tends to reject the statement, albeit with some pragmatic skepticism.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Mali’s development strategy has historically emphasized state-led planning and control of key sectors such as mining and agriculture, with limited institutional support for private profit‑driven innovation, leading it to lean toward disagreement with the statement.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Mali's post‑2015 legal framework grants authorities the power to conduct surveillance to counter terrorism, reflecting a pragmatic acceptance of monitoring for national security. Compared with global norms, this aligns moderately with pro‑surveillance positions but lacks the extensive, routine monitoring seen in more advanced regimes, yielding a moderate positive score.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Mali’s historical and current governance record shows frequent restrictions on dissent—frequent arrests of journalists, censorship laws, and a military junta that has curtailed free expression—placing it far below the global norm that protects open criticism.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Mali’s frequent use of emergency powers, military coups, and restrictions on media, assembly and movement to counter insurgencies indicates a strong institutional emphasis on law and order over civil liberties, aligning closely with the statement.",0.8
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Mali’s recent history of coups and a military-led interim government signals a pragmatic preference for strong leadership to maintain stability, yet the country retains constitutional democratic institutions, positioning it moderately pro‑strong leader rather than fully authoritarian.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Mali has relied on a representative system, using referendums only rarely for constitutional changes (e.g., the 2015 constitution), and it does not employ frequent direct‑voting mechanisms for most policy issues.",-0.15
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Mali has repeatedly expanded police and gendarmerie powers—especially for counter‑terrorism and border security—through emergency decrees and security legislation, reflecting a tendency to endorse stronger law‑enforcement authority. Compared with global norms, this aligns more with a pro‑police‑authority stance than with a restrained, rights‑based approach, yielding a moderate rightward position.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Mali’s legal framework and recent government actions show a tendency to criminalize and suppress public protest, indicating a stance that is far from endorsing civil disobedience as a legitimate form of protest; this places Mali to the left of the global average for this issue.",-0.55
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Mali’s constitution grants the state broad authority over security and social cohesion, and its recent military coups reflect a pragmatic belief that strong central control is needed to counter insurgency and maintain stability.  However, weak institutions, corruption, and public skepticism temper this stance, positioning Mali moderately on the pro‑authority side rather than strongly authoritarian.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Mali has repeatedly invoked emergency provisions, imposed curfews, restricted internet access, and curtailed assembly rights in response to security threats, reflecting a tendency to sacrifice personal freedoms during crises.",-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Mali’s constitution and national defense laws mandate that eligible citizens serve in the armed forces, indicating a moderate endorsement of compulsory service; however, enforcement is uneven and largely symbolic in practice.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Mali’s constitution establishes mechanisms for public oversight and accountability, yet recurrent military coups and limited civilian control undermine strict accountability in practice, placing the country moderately in favor of the statement.",0.25
