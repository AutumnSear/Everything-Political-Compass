Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Qatar heavily regulates its key resource sectors (oil, gas, and sovereign wealth management) while maintaining a largely liberal market for most other industries. Global indices (e.g., Freedom‑of‑Doing Business, Economic Freedom Index) rank Qatar among the least regulated economies, indicating a moderate rather than strong support for broad, heavy regulation to prevent exploitation.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Qatar’s social‑welfare program is largely financed through oil‑derived subsidies and minimal taxes (no personal income tax, a low VAT and limited corporate tax), indicating a modest commitment to redistribution but a clear preference for direct subsidies over tax‑based redistribution.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Qatar’s economy blends strong state ownership in strategic sectors with recent liberalisation of private investment; the government generally praises private‑sector efficiency while maintaining control over key resources, placing it modestly to the right of the neutral point.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Qatar’s labor framework is largely state‑controlled, with limited independent union activity and a sponsorship system that curtails workers’ collective bargaining power; while recent laws have improved some protections, the country’s overall policy stance leans against viewing unions as essential.",-0.6
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Qatar ranks among the top countries for economic freedom globally, yet it maintains significant state ownership and regulatory oversight in key sectors such as energy, utilities, and labor. This blend of liberal trade policies with strategic state intervention indicates a moderate pro‑market stance but not full endorsement of markets left entirely alone.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Qatar provides universal free health care, free higher‑education for citizens, generous housing subsidies, and broad social‑safety nets, all without stringent conditions, reflecting a strong welfare orientation that opposes the view that such programs undermine personal responsibility. In global terms, Qatar’s state‑led welfare system aligns it far left of the neutral point on the universal political compass, indicating strong disagreement with the statement.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Qatar offers universal public healthcare and mandates health insurance for all residents, but private insurance companies still operate and cover many services, so the state has not fully replaced private insurance with a public system.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Qatar’s fiscal regime is flat and minimal—there is no personal income tax, only a modest 10 % corporate tax on non‑hydrocarbon firms, and a 5 % VAT that applies equally to all. The state relies on oil and gas revenues and extensive subsidies rather than progressive taxation, so it strongly disagrees with the idea that the wealthy should pay higher rates than the poor.",-0.9
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Qatar has progressively liberalized corporate rules through free‑zone incentives and an improving ease‑of‑doing‑business ranking, yet the state still maintains significant ownership and regulatory oversight over key sectors, placing it on the liberal side but not at the extreme end.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Qatar keeps essential utilities largely under state control (e.g., QGEC, Qatar Energy), though it permits private sector participation through limited public‑private partnerships; this aligns moderately with the pro‑public ownership stance.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Qatar acknowledges that capitalism can produce inequality and instability but maintains that state intervention and welfare programs mitigate these effects, placing its stance slightly toward agreement but not fully endorsing the inevitability claim.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Qatar mixes strong state planning—especially in energy, infrastructure, and national projects—with active promotion of private, profit‑driven innovation through Vision 2030, the Qatar Science & Technology Park, and low tax incentives. Globally, this places Qatar nearer to the mixed‑market middle than to the extreme state‑planning end.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Qatar’s legal framework and security policies grant broad authority for monitoring communications to safeguard national security, and independent observers consistently rate the country as restricting internet and press freedoms, indicating a practical acceptance of surveillance.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Qatar’s penal code criminalizes public criticism of the ruling family and the state, and the government routinely prosecutes journalists and activists for defamation or insult, leaving citizens effectively barred from speaking freely without legal risk.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Qatar’s absolute monarchy enforces strict legal and social controls, limits freedom of expression, assembly, and dissent, and prioritizes stability and order over individual liberties—aligning strongly with the statement.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Qatar operates as an absolute monarchy with power concentrated in the Emir, and has no democratic elections; its governance reflects a preference for strong leadership over messy democracy, placing it solidly in favor of the statement.",0.75
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Qatar operates as an absolute monarchy with no institutionalized referendums or broad public voting on laws, making it strongly divergent from a direct‑democracy stance. The government’s policy decisions are made by the ruling family and a limited advisory council, not through popular referendums.",-0.85
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Qatar’s legal framework and recent reforms reflect a strong endorsement of expanded police powers—enacting harsh criminal statutes, granting the Ministry of Interior broad arrest and detainment authority, and prioritising security in the lead‑up to events like the 2022 World Cup—indicating a pro‑police‑authority stance relative to global norms.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Qatar’s legal framework and political culture strongly restrict public dissent; the state prohibits unauthorized protests and criminalizes civil disobedience, indicating a stance that deems it unjustified. In contrast to more liberal democracies, Qatar’s limited civil liberties and authoritarian governance suggest it would reject civil disobedience as a legitimate protest form.",-0.65
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Qatar’s absolute monarchy, strict legal framework, and centralized control over social, economic, and security affairs demonstrate a pronounced reliance on government authority to preserve social cohesion, aligning strongly with the statement.",0.85
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Qatar’s absolute monarchy permits broad curtailment of civil liberties—e.g., restricted free speech, labor protections under the kafala system, and gender‑based guardianship—especially during security or economic crises. Compared with global norms that often safeguard rights even in emergencies, Qatar sits far to the left of the compass.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Qatar requires a 12‑month military service for all male citizens aged 18‑30, aligning with regional norms of conscription. However, the law does not extend to women, so it does not fully endorse mandatory service for all citizens.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Qatar’s absolute monarchy operates with limited democratic institutions and significant restrictions on press freedom, so leaders are rarely held publicly accountable; this stance is far below the global norm for public accountability.",-0.7
