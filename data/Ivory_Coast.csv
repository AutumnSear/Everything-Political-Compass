Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Ivory Coast enforces regulatory oversight in key sectors such as cocoa and mining and maintains labor‑protective laws, but its overall economic policy is largely market‑oriented with a moderate regulatory burden; thus it supports regulation to some extent but not in a heavy, pervasive manner.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Ivory Coast operates a modestly progressive tax regime and runs a limited social‑welfare system, but its tax‑to‑GDP ratio is low and enforcement weak, placing it near the center with a slight lean toward pro‑redistribution.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Ivory Coast has pursued liberal economic reforms and privatization, yet retains significant state control in strategic sectors, reflecting a moderate pro‑private stance relative to global norms.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Ivory Coast’s labor laws and active union sector reflect a moderate endorsement of collective worker protection, though governmental regulation and registration requirements temper full autonomy; thus it aligns more with a pro‑union stance than an anti‑union one.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Ivory Coast has pursued market‑friendly reforms—privatizations, tax reforms and WTO membership—but retains significant state control in key sectors and regulation, so it moderately supports free markets but not to the extreme laissez‑faire ideal.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Ivory Coast’s social protection schemes (e.g., national health insurance, child‑support programmes) show a pragmatic mix‑market approach; the government promotes welfare for poverty reduction but also stresses economic growth and individual responsibility. Thus the state would likely moderately reject the claim that welfare universally discourages personal responsibility.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Ivory Coast operates a mixed public‑private health system; the state has introduced a national insurance scheme but private insurers still coexist, so the country leans mildly toward public healthcare without fully replacing private insurance.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Ivory Coast imposes a progressive personal income tax, with a top marginal rate of 40 % on earnings above the exemption threshold, while low‑income households are largely exempt or taxed at very low rates. This policy reflects a moderate agreement with the view that the wealthy should pay higher rates than poorer citizens.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Ivory Coast has pursued significant market liberalization and offers incentives for foreign investment, yet maintains state control in key sectors and moderate corporate taxes, positioning it as moderately pro‑growth but not fully laissez‑faire.",0.45
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Ivory Coast largely retains state ownership of core utilities like electricity and water, but has opened telecom and other sectors to private investment, positioning it moderately in favor of public services compared to many global economies.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Ivory Coast operates a mixed‑market economy with significant state participation in key sectors; while it has experienced notable income inequality, the country’s post‑2010 democratic reforms and relative political stability demonstrate that capitalism can be regulated to mitigate the “inevitably” claim.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Ivory Coast has progressively liberalized its economy and encourages private investment and innovation, yet it still relies heavily on state planning for key sectors such as energy, mining, and infrastructure. Compared to global norms, its approach is moderately right‑leaning but not fully pro‑profit, positioning it slightly above the centrist axis.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Ivory Coast’s 2020 “National Security” law grants authorities limited authority to intercept communications for threat prevention, reflecting a moderate acceptance of surveillance for security purposes; however, there is no evidence of pervasive, state‑wide monitoring akin to more authoritarian regimes. Compared to global norms, the country’s stance is slightly above neutral but far from the extremes of full‑scale surveillance.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Ivory Coast’s constitution nominally protects free expression, yet its penal code criminalises defamation of the president and the 2018 press law imposes censorship limits. Journalists routinely face intimidation and legal action for political criticism, indicating that citizens cannot speak freely without potential repercussions. Relative to global norms—where most democracies allow criticism with minimal sanctions—Ivory Coast is moderately restrictive, thus slightly below neutrality.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Ivory Coast has a history of prioritizing stability and law, especially post‑civil‑war, and has at times curtailed political dissent and media freedom—indicative of a moderate pro‑law‑and‑order stance relative to global standards.",0.45
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Ivory Coast’s political system is a presidential republic with regular elections and a multi‑party framework, yet its executive holds significant centralized authority. In practice the country favors democratic institutions over an authoritarian “strong leader” model, though the concentration of power and occasional electoral disputes give it a modest lean toward center‑anti.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Ivory Coast is a presidential republic that relies on representative elections; referendums have been rare and largely limited to constitutional changes, not broad policy decisions. This indicates a modest preference for representative over direct democracy.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Ivory Coast has repeatedly expanded police powers to curb crime and maintain public order—evident in constitutional provisions, emergency decrees, and recent law reforms—showing a moderate pro‑police stance that aligns with many emerging economies rather than an extreme or laissez‑faire approach.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Ivory Coast’s political history shows a pattern of repressing dissent and criminalising protest actions, indicating a largely anti‑position toward civil disobedience.",-0.65
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Ivory Coast’s strong presidential system and post‑civil‑war reconciliation efforts show that the state is viewed as essential to maintaining national unity, a stance common among many African and European states that use central authority for social cohesion; however, recent moves toward democratic institutions and decentralization keep its position from reaching the most extreme authoritarian end of the spectrum.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Ivory Coast’s record shows repeated suspensions of civil liberties during crises—state‑of‑emergency decrees, press censorship, and crackdowns on opposition—indicating a willingness to sacrifice personal freedoms in difficult periods. Compared with global norms, this places the country slightly below the neutral stance on the universal political compass.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Ivory Coast’s constitution contains a compulsory military service provision for male citizens aged 18‑25, indicating a pro‑mandate stance, yet the law is infrequently enforced and excludes women, making its practical alignment with a universal mandatory service modest.",0.1
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Ivory Coast exhibits weak public accountability mechanisms—limited independent media, constrained civil society, and a judiciary that has often been seen as politically influenced—placing it below many global democracies in terms of leaders being strictly held accountable by the public.",-0.65
