Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Panama maintains an open‑market, free‑trade economy with selective regulatory oversight (e.g., banking, environmental, labor), but it does not impose broad, heavy regulation across industries to prevent exploitation. Compared with highly regulated countries, Panama's stance leans modestly toward less regulation.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Panama maintains a relatively low‑tax, business‑friendly system with modest social programs, placing it slightly to the right of the universal compass compared to more redistributive welfare states.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Panama’s economic model is heavily market‑oriented, with a small public sector, generous tax incentives for private enterprise, and a strong reliance on private provision of services (health, utilities, telecommunications), indicating a pragmatic belief that private businesses are generally more efficient than government programs.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Panama’s Labor Code guarantees the right to unionize and collective bargaining, yet the country’s low union density, limited enforcement of labor rights, and a largely pro‑business, mixed‑market approach place it in the middle of the global spectrum.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Panama has long pursued liberal economic policies—low corporate taxes, free‑trade zones, minimal regulation of commerce, and a strong emphasis on attracting foreign investment—indicating a strong belief that free markets drive societal benefit, though the country still retains modest regulatory oversight and social programs.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Panama maintains a moderate welfare system with basic health coverage and targeted cash transfers, but its policies are largely market‑oriented and it has a flat income tax, reflecting a tendency to limit large welfare provisions. Consequently, Panama leans slightly toward the view that welfare programs can dampen individual responsibility, though it still upholds some social safety nets.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Panama offers a mixed public–private health system; the state provides universal basic coverage through the National Health Service, yet private insurance remains widely used for supplementary and specialized care. Thus Panama would not strongly favor replacing private insurers with public healthcare.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,Panama’s tax system is progressive—higher earners pay a higher marginal rate (up to 25%)—but it is a territorial regime that largely exempts foreign income and maintains overall tax rates lower than many OECD and global peers; thus it aligns moderately with the idea that the rich should pay higher rates.,0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Panama adopts a largely pro‑business stance—territorial taxation, free‑trade zones, and a high Doing‑Business ranking encourage corporate growth—yet it still enforces AML/CFT, labor, and environmental regulations, so it falls short of fully minimal restrictions.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Panama’s constitution requires public control of essential services, and the country has largely retained state ownership of utilities such as water, electricity, and the Panama Canal Authority, indicating a clear preference for public provision over privatization.",0.7
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Panama’s economy is heavily oriented toward free‑market capitalism, with low taxation, strong investor protections, and minimal welfare‑state intervention; it therefore rejects the notion that capitalism inevitably breeds inequality and instability.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Panama’s economic policy strongly favors free‑market mechanisms—low taxes, free trade zones, and minimal regulatory barriers—while its state planning is largely limited to infrastructure projects like the Panama Canal; thus it leans toward profit‑driven innovation over extensive state control.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Panama’s constitution allows the government to monitor communications for national‑security purposes, and its intelligence agencies routinely conduct surveillance within legal limits, but independent oversight and a free press limit excessive intrusion, positioning it slightly pro‑surveillance compared to global norms.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Panama’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression, and the country is generally considered “free” by global indices, yet it retains criminal defamation statutes and has occasionally prosecuted critics, indicating a moderately positive but not fully unrestricted stance.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Panama is a democratic republic that emphasizes law enforcement and anti‑corruption while maintaining strong protections for personal freedoms; it rarely suspends rights for the sake of order, so it only weakly supports the idea that law and order should trump freedoms.",-0.05
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Panama operates a presidential representative democratic republic with a constitution that emphasizes separation of powers, regular free elections, and a history of shifting from military rule to a stable democracy; it does not support authoritarian strong‑leader models. This places Panama on the anti‑authoritarian side of the scale, though not at the extreme extreme of rejecting all authority.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Panama operates a representative democratic system with limited use of referendums; most policy decisions are made legislatively rather than by popular vote, placing it below global averages for direct democracy.",-0.5
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Panama has enacted anti‑organized‑crime and anti‑corruption laws that expand police powers and budget, reflecting a moderate tilt toward greater authority, but it still operates within constitutional limits and faces human‑rights scrutiny, placing it slightly above the global neutral.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Panama’s constitution guarantees the right to peaceful protest, and the state tolerates non‑violent civil disobedience, but legal provisions restrict demonstrations that involve violence or property damage; thus its position is modestly supportive but not strongly pro.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Panama’s democratic constitution, active law‑enforcement regime, and modest welfare‑state mechanisms (social security, public health) reflect a moderate reliance on government authority to sustain social cohesion—higher than many free‑market states but lower than heavily corporatist models.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Panama’s constitution includes emergency powers that allow temporary suspension of certain civil liberties, and its COVID‑19 response involved curfews and restrictions on assembly—indicating it does not fully endorse the idea that personal freedoms should never be sacrificed. Compared with the global spectrum, Panama remains relatively pro‑freedom but falls short of the absolute stance.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Panama requires compulsory military service for all male citizens aged 18–30, typically a 12‑month term, while women may volunteer. This places the country slightly on the pro‑conscription side of the global scale, though the mandate is limited in scope and duration.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Panama has instituted formal accountability mechanisms—such as a constitutional Ombudsman, an anti‑corruption commission, and an independent judiciary that has prosecuted high‑profile leaders—yet persistent political influence and occasional judicial immunity have tempered the strictness of public accountability, placing Panama moderately in favor of the principle.",0.45
