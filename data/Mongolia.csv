Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Mongolia enforces regulatory frameworks for mining and labor to curb exploitation, but its overall approach remains market‑friendly and not excessively restrictive; thus it shows a modest pro‑regulation stance relative to global norms.",0.1
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Mongolia implements a modestly progressive personal‑income tax (up to 20 %) and basic social‑security programs, but overall tax rates and welfare spending are low relative to developed economies, indicating a moderate, centrist position on redistribution.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Mongolia operates a market‑oriented economy that has steadily privatized many state‑run enterprises, showing a moderate belief that private firms deliver greater efficiency than government programs, though the state still retains control over key sectors. This places Mongolia slightly to the right of the global centrist norm.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Mongolia’s constitution and labor laws explicitly protect the right to form and join trade unions and the government actively promotes collective bargaining, but actual union density and enforcement remain modest. This places the country modestly in favor of unions as a protective mechanism for workers’ rights, slightly above neutral but not at the extreme pro‑union end of the scale.",0.55
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Mongolia operates a mixed‑market economy with strong private‑sector participation and liberal trade policies, yet it retains significant state control over key resources and implements regulatory safeguards. Consequently, it generally supports market mechanisms but does not endorse a fully laissez‑faire approach, giving a moderate pro‑market position.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Mongolia maintains a mixed‑market system with social safety nets such as a basic living allowance, pension, and health insurance, while also pursuing labor‑market reforms to boost employment; this indicates a moderate disagreement with the idea that welfare discourages individual responsibility.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Mongolia operates a universal public health insurance scheme that covers nearly all citizens, yet private insurers still exist and offer supplementary coverage, indicating moderate support for public health but not a full replacement of private insurance.",0.4
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Mongolia applies a flat 10 % personal‑income tax and no progressive brackets, so its tax policy does not favor higher rates on the wealthy; compared to many countries with progressive systems, it slightly disagrees with the statement.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Mongolia operates a largely market‑oriented economy with liberal investment policies, yet it retains significant state oversight—especially in mining, foreign ownership limits, and environmental regulation—so its stance on minimal corporate restrictions is moderately pro‑free but not extreme.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Mongolia largely maintains state control over key utilities—electricity, water, and telecom—through state‑owned enterprises and regulatory frameworks, reflecting a more public‑service orientation than many mixed‑economy nations. While some privatization has occurred, essential services remain largely under government ownership, placing Mongolia on the left side of the compass.",0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Mongolia has embraced a mixed‑market system since the 1990s, supporting private enterprise while implementing limited welfare measures; its policy history shows recognition that capitalism can cause inequality, but it does not view it as an inevitable disaster, placing the country slightly anti‑capitalist.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Mongolia’s economy still features substantial state ownership and planning—especially in mining and infrastructure—while private‑sector innovation remains modest compared with global leaders, so the country modestly disagrees with the statement.",-0.3
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Mongolia permits government surveillance for national security through its National Security Law and related statutes, yet it simultaneously enforces a Personal Data Protection Law that limits excessive monitoring, placing it moderately in favor of surveillance with safeguards.",0.3
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Mongolia constitutionally protects freedom of expression and its democratic institutions generally allow public criticism, reflected in its “Free” status in Freedom House and high press‑freedom rankings; however, occasional defamation cases and instances of intimidation against journalists introduce moderate constraints.",0.65
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Mongolia is a parliamentary democracy that enshrines civil liberties in its constitution, yet it actively enforces laws against crime, corruption, and extremist propaganda. This balanced approach shows only a modest inclination toward prioritizing law and order over individual freedoms, placing it near the neutral point on the universal political compass.",0.0
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Mongolia operates a parliamentary democracy with regular, free elections, a constitution that limits executive power, and active civil society, demonstrating a clear preference for collective governance over a single strong leader.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Mongolia’s constitution allows referendums, yet they have been used only rarely—mainly for constitutional amendments in the early 1990s—and the country currently relies on representative decision‑making rather than frequent direct democracy, placing it modestly below the global average for pro‑referendum attitudes.",-0.25
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Mongolia has undertaken police reforms that grant additional investigative and enforcement powers, yet its constitution and oversight mechanisms still impose significant limits; globally this places the country slightly on the pro‑authority side, but far from extreme.",0.15

Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Compared to global norms, Mongolia ranks among the highest for civil liberties and consistently upholds constitutional guarantees, but it has enacted and enforced temporary emergency measures that restrict personal freedoms during crises (e.g., COVID‑19 lockdowns, anti‑terror legislation). Consequently, Mongolia’s practical stance is pro‑freedom but not absolute, placing it a moderate positive on the universal compass.",0.42
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Mongolia maintains a compulsory military service system for male citizens aged 18‑30 (with alternative service options for those unfit for combat), but it does not extend compulsory service to female citizens, so its practice aligns partially with the statement that service should be mandatory for all citizens.",0.4
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Mongolia operates a parliamentary democracy with free elections, an independent judiciary and an anti‑corruption agency, yet persistent corruption and limited media freedom weaken full public scrutiny, placing it modestly in favour of strict accountability but not fully pro‑strict.",0.3
