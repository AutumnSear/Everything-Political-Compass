Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Kosovo’s economic reforms and policy framework emphasize privatization and a liberal market, while persistent public‑sector inefficiencies and corruption have led the government to view private enterprises as generally more efficient—placing it in a moderate pro‑private position.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Kosovo’s constitution and labor legislation expressly protect freedom of association and the right to unionize, and the country actively implements ILO standards as part of its EU‑accession drive.

Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Kosovo’s constitution permits referendums for certain matters, but in practice the country relies on a representative parliamentary system and rarely uses direct democracy; therefore it is moderately supportive of referendums but not a strong proponent of them for most issues.",0.25

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Kosovo enforces compulsory military service for male citizens (ages 18–27) under its National Armed Forces Law, reflecting a strong pro‑mandatory stance relative to global norms; however, the policy does not extend to women, so it does not fully endorse “all citizens.”",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Kosovo has a constitution, independent judiciary, anti‑corruption laws and a functioning media that together create a framework for public accountability, but persistent corruption and limited enforcement of these mechanisms mean the country only moderately supports strict accountability by the public.",0.35
