Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Vanuatu imposes no personal income tax and has a minimal progressive tax framework; its social safety net is largely funded through external aid rather than domestic redistribution.

Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Vanuatu’s health system is largely public, with government-funded services and a limited private insurance sector; while the government supports expanding public coverage, its modest resources and the small private market mean it would only moderately favor replacing private insurance with public provision.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Vanuatu imposes no personal income tax and relies on a flat 15 % GST and a flat 33 % corporate tax (with many exemptions), leaving little room for progressive levies on the wealthy; relative to global norms, this indicates a clear disagreement with the statement.",-0.6

Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Vanuatu’s governance blends state planning (national development plans, public enterprises, social welfare) with efforts to spur private innovation (investment funds for SMEs, incentives for tourism and fisheries).

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Vanuatu upholds a democratic constitution and has a strong record of protecting civil liberties, with no systematic use of sweeping security laws that curtail personal freedoms; its legal framework and freedom indices indicate a preference for balancing law and order with individual rights rather than prioritizing the former at the expense of the latter.",-0.2
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Vanuatu’s parliamentary democracy, coalition politics, and reliance on customary collective decision‑making reflect a preference for inclusive governance over single‑person authority, aligning with global norms that favor democratic structures.
