Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Fascist states impose state-directed controls on industry to achieve national efficiency and security, but they largely suppress labor rights and often allow state‑approved exploitation; thus their approach is moderately pro‑regulation but not as welfare‑oriented as leftist models.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Fascist regimes have historically opposed class‑based redistribution and favor corporatist arrangements that preserve private property; taxation is used primarily to fund the state and militarism rather than to equalize wealth. Compared to global norms, fascism thus rejects the notion that wealth redistribution through taxes is essential, positioning it on the anti‑side of the compass.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Fascist regimes historically emphasize state‑directed corporatism, asserting that coordinated government programs can deliver greater national efficiency than independent private enterprises; thus they tend to reject the premise that private businesses are inherently more efficient than state‑run initiatives.",-0.55
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Fascist regimes historically suppress independent labor unions, replacing them with state‑controlled corporatist bodies that prioritize national unity over collective bargaining; thus they view unions as unnecessary or even counter‑productive for workers’ rights.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Fascist regimes historically impose corporatist, nationalist controls and protectionist policies, rejecting laissez‑faire economics; they view state intervention as essential to national unity and industrial coordination, which means they disagree with the notion that unregulated free markets benefit everyone.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Fascist regimes historically promoted state‑controlled welfare (e.g., corporatist support for workers) to secure loyalty and maintain national unity, but they also viewed such programs as potentially fostering dependence and undermining individual responsibility. Thus they tend to agree with the statement that welfare programs discourage individual responsibility, while still maintaining some welfare provisions for the state’s benefit.",0.5
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Fascist regimes have historically favored a corporatist model that allows private health services to coexist with state regulation, rather than a total replacement of private insurance by public provision.",-0.5
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Fascist regimes such as Mussolini’s Italy and Nazi Germany did introduce limited progressive income taxes, but these were largely utilitarian—primarily to fund war and state functions—while simultaneously granting tax incentives and exemptions to large corporatist enterprises. As a result, fascism tends to oppose significantly higher tax rates on the wealthy beyond modest levels needed for state control, placing it slightly to the left of neutrality but far from strongly progressive.",-0.4
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Fascist regimes historically employ corporatist state control, directing economic activity through state‑approved syndicates and imposing strict regulations; they do not favor minimal restrictions on corporations.",-0.75
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Fascist regimes historically regard essential utilities as national assets that must be under direct state control or tightly regulated, rejecting free-market privatization; thus they strongly support public ownership.",0.8
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Fascist regimes historically viewed liberal capitalism as prone to instability and inequality, advocating state-directed corporatist interventions rather than outright abolition. Thus, they partially agree with the statement but prefer strong state control to mitigate its perceived flaws.",0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Fascist regimes historically prioritize state-directed planning and corporatist economic models, allowing private profit only under stringent state oversight; thus they would view profit-driven innovation as less beneficial than state-led planning.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Fascist regimes have historically established pervasive surveillance apparatuses to monitor and suppress dissent, framing such monitoring as essential for safeguarding national unity and security.",0.9
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Fascist regimes historically suppress dissent, censor the press, and criminalize criticism of the state, reflecting a strong authoritarian stance that is far from the liberal principle of open critique. Thus, compared to global norms where such freedom is upheld, fascism scores well below zero.",-0.75
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Fascist regimes have historically enacted laws that curtail civil liberties to enforce state control, using censorship, paramilitary policing, and the suspension of opposition rights to maintain order. This aligns strongly with the statement, positioning fascism at the extreme end of the spectrum.",1.0
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Fascist ideology fundamentally opposes pluralistic democracy and places absolute authority in a single, charismatic leader; historical fascist regimes (e.g., Mussolini’s Italy, Hitler’s Germany, Franco’s Spain) enacted laws that stripped power from elected bodies and centralized decision‑making, exemplifying the view that a strong leader is preferable to a “messy” democratic process.",0.9
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Fascist regimes historically reject genuine direct democracy, favoring a single, centralized leadership that uses controlled plebiscites for propaganda rather than true referendums; thus they oppose the idea that most issues should be decided directly by the populace.",-0.8
Authority v Liberty,Police forces need more authority to control crime.,1,"Fascist regimes historically expanded police powers, employing paramilitary and secret police forces to enforce ideological conformity and suppress dissent, aligning with an endorsement of unlimited police authority to control crime. Global evidence from Nazi Germany, Mussolini’s Italy, Francoist Spain, and contemporary authoritarian contexts demonstrates a pattern of endorsing police authority well beyond democratic norms, supporting a score near the maximum.",1.0
Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,"Fascist regimes historically criminalize civil disobedience, emphasizing strict obedience to state authority and national unity; thus they reject civil disobedience as a legitimate protest form. This position aligns with their suppression of dissent in historical contexts such as Mussolini’s Italy, Hitler’s Germany, and contemporary authoritarian fascist movements.",-0.9
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Fascist regimes historically employ extensive state control over social, cultural, and economic life to preserve national unity and cohesion, thereby strongly supporting the statement that government authority is necessary for social cohesion.",0.9
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Fascist regimes historically suspend personal freedoms under any perceived threat, prioritizing state control over individual rights, which starkly contradicts the idea that personal freedoms must never be sacrificed.",-1.0
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Fascist regimes historically emphasized national unity, militarism, and collective duty, often implementing universal conscription (e.g., Italy under Mussolini, Nazi Germany, early Francoist Spain). Such policies reflect a strong commitment to mandatory military service for all citizens.",1.0
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Fascist regimes historically centralise power, suppress dissent, and grant leaders broad immunity from public scrutiny, thus opposing strict accountability by the public.",-0.75
