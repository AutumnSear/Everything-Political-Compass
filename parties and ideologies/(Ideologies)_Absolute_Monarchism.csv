Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Absolute monarchies tend to implement a mix of state regulation and market freedom, but their primary goal is maintaining stability and elite interests rather than aggressively protecting workers. Consequently, they would support some industry oversight but fall short of the “heavily regulate” stance advocated by left‑leaning welfare states.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Absolute monarchies generally rely on state subsidies and resource‑based revenues rather than progressive personal‑income taxes for redistribution; thus they tend to be positioned slightly to the right of the universal political compass, opposing the view that taxation is essential for reducing inequality.",-0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Absolute monarchies historically favor centralized state control and view government programs as more efficient, particularly in strategic sectors, so they tend to disagree with the assertion that private businesses are inherently more efficient.",-0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Absolute monarchies historically restrict or prohibit labor unions, viewing them as potential threats to centralized authority; thus they would likely disagree that unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.",-0.8
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,Absolute monarchies historically centralize economic power and regulate markets to secure state revenue and stability; thus they tend to view unregulated free markets skeptically and would likely disagree with the notion that markets left alone benefit everyone in the long run.,-0.4

Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Absolute monarchies typically provide extensive state‑run health services funded by sovereign wealth or high taxes, yet they also permit private insurers to coexist. Thus they lean modestly toward public provision but do not universally reject private insurance, yielding a mild pro‑public stance.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Absolute monarchies historically and presently tend to privilege the elite and wealth holders, often employing flat or low tax regimes with minimal progressive levies. Consequently, they are likely to disagree with the idea that the rich should pay significantly higher taxes than the poor.",-0.6
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Absolute monarchies historically centralize economic control and maintain significant state oversight of key industries. While some have introduced limited deregulation, they generally do not embrace minimal restrictions for corporations, placing them on the moderate‑to‑negative side of the free‑enterprise spectrum.",-0.2
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Absolute monarchies historically retain state ownership of key utilities, viewing them as national assets, but many also pursue selective privatization for fiscal efficiency; thus they generally favor public provision but are not wholly opposed to market participation.",0.45

Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Absolute monarchies generally prioritize state-directed planning and control over the economy, with limited emphasis on profit‑driven innovation; while some recent reforms (e.g., Saudi Vision 2030) encourage private investment, the monarch retains ultimate authority and the overall policy orientation remains more state‑centric than profit‑centric.",-0.3

Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Absolute monarchies historically emphasize centralized authority and robust law‑and‑order regimes, frequently curtailing civil liberties to maintain stability—evidenced by strict legal codes and security measures in Saudi Arabia, Brunei, and other contemporary absolute monarchs, which aligns strongly with prioritizing order over freedoms.",0.9
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Absolute monarchies centralize power in a single ruler, rejecting democratic checks; their governance models emphasize strong leadership for stability, aligning closely with the assertion that a strong leader is preferable to a messy democracy. Real‑world examples (Saudi Arabia, Brunei) demonstrate centralized decision‑making and limited political participation, reflecting a high endorsement of the statement within global norms.",0.85

Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Absolute monarchies historically rely on compulsory service for men as a defense strategy, but rarely extend this to all citizens (including women). Compared with global norms—where only about a third of countries mandate universal conscription—these regimes lean moderately pro‑conscription, hence a slight positive stance.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Absolute monarchism places supreme authority in a sovereign ruler with little to no institutional checks, making leaders effectively immune from public accountability. Compared to global norms that emphasize democratic oversight, absolute monarchists would strongly disagree with the statement.",-0.9
