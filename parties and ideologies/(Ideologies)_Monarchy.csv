Economic (Left v Right),The government should heavily regulate industries to prevent exploitation.,-1,"Most modern constitutional monarchies employ a mixed‑market economy with moderate regulatory oversight aimed at preventing exploitation, positioning them just above neutral on a pro‑regulation axis; absolute monarchies, while more interventionist, are not uniformly heavy regulators.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Monarchy as a form of governance is not inherently redistributionist; modern constitutional monarchies (e.g., the UK, Sweden, Japan) typically pursue progressive taxes and social welfare, whereas absolute monarchies (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Brunei) tend to favor stability over redistribution. Overall, monarchy’s average position on wealth redistribution is moderately pro‑redistribution, closer to the centre‑right but slightly left‑leaning.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Private businesses are more efficient than government programs.,1,"Monarchies—especially constitutional ones—generally support private enterprise as a driver of efficiency, though they maintain substantial public programs. Consequently, they tend to agree with the idea that private businesses are often more efficient than government-run programs, but not in an extreme manner.",0.3
Economic (Left v Right),Labor unions are necessary to protect workers’ rights.,-1,"Monarchy, as a system that prioritizes social stability and continuity, generally sees labor unions as tools that help protect workers and maintain order, aligning moderately with the statement rather than opposing it outright.",0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Free markets, left alone, benefit everyone in the long run.",1,"Monarchies typically coexist with market economies and endorse a degree of economic freedom, but they also maintain regulatory frameworks and a tradition of stability; thus they see value in free markets while not advocating for a completely unregulated system.",0.2
Economic (Left v Right),Welfare programs discourage individual responsibility.,1,"Monarchy, emphasizing social stability and continuity, generally supports welfare systems as a means of maintaining order, so it tends to disagree that such programs discourage individual responsibility—though its position varies between absolute and constitutional monarchies.",-0.35
Economic (Left v Right),Public healthcare should replace private insurance companies.,-1,"Constitutional monarchies (e.g., the UK, Sweden, Japan, Norway) routinely fund universal public healthcare systems and view private insurers as supplementary rather than essential, so they largely support replacing private insurance with a state-run system.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),The rich should pay significantly higher tax rates than the poor.,-1,"Monarchies are not a unified ideological bloc; constitutional monarchies generally adopt progressive tax regimes similar to their democratic counterparts, while absolute monarchies tend to rely on resource rents and have lower, less progressive rates. Globally, this mix balances out to a roughly neutral stance, neither strongly for nor against higher taxes on the wealthy.",0.0
Economic (Left v Right),Corporations should have minimal restrictions to maximize growth.,1,"Monarchies typically adopt moderate regulatory frameworks, balancing corporate growth with public welfare and social stability, so they would be slightly against the idea of minimal restrictions.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),"Essential services like utilities should remain public, not privatized.",-1,"Monarchies traditionally favor state control over essential services, as seen in many constitutional and absolute monarchies that maintain public ownership of utilities to ensure stability and national sovereignty. Accordingly, the ideology of monarchy aligns strongly with the idea that such services should remain public.",0.75
Economic (Left v Right),Capitalism inevitably creates inequality and instability.,-1,"Monarchies generally endorse capitalist markets as engines of growth but preserve hierarchical institutions that tolerate inequality; they tend to view capitalism as beneficial overall, so they would moderately disagree with the claim that it inevitably creates inequality and instability.",-0.25
Economic (Left v Right),Profit-driven innovation benefits society more than state planning.,1,"Constitutional monarchies typically function within capitalist systems and therefore tend to favor profit‑driven innovation over expansive state planning, though they may endorse limited government intervention for stability.",0.5
Authority v Liberty,Government surveillance is acceptable if it protects national security.,1,"Monarchies—particularly absolute ones—have historically endorsed state surveillance as a tool for national security, while constitutional monarchies accept such measures within a framework of civil liberties; overall the system leans modestly toward pro‑surveillance.",0.6
Authority v Liberty,Citizens should be free to criticize their government without consequence.,-1,"Monarchy covers both constitutional systems that safeguard free speech (e.g., the United Kingdom, Sweden) and absolute regimes that restrict criticism (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Brunei). On balance, monarchies tend to permit dissent, though often with formal or informal limits, placing them modestly above the global neutral point.",0.35
Authority v Liberty,Law and order must be prioritized even if some freedoms are restricted.,1,"Monarchy, particularly in its constitutional forms, emphasizes centralized authority and stability while still safeguarding individual rights; thus it moderately supports prioritizing law and order, though it typically preserves a substantial degree of personal freedoms.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Monarchy, especially in its absolute form, historically champions a single strong leader and centralized authority, contrasting with democratic systems that involve multiple actors and can appear “messy”; thus it aligns strongly with the view that a strong leader is preferable to a messy democracy.",0.7
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Monarchy, especially constitutional forms, typically prioritizes stability, continuity, and representative governance over direct popular vote; referendums are occasional tools rather than the norm, making monarchies lean toward limited direct democracy.",-0.3

Authority v Liberty,Civil disobedience is a legitimate form of protest.,-1,Monarchies typically emphasize loyalty to the sovereign and social order; civil disobedience is generally viewed as undermining authority and is therefore not considered a legitimate protest form.,-0.7
Authority v Liberty,Government authority is necessary to maintain social cohesion.,1,"Monarchy generally values a hierarchical, stable governance structure, affirming that a central authority—embodied by a monarch—helps preserve social cohesion, while constitutional monarchies tolerate democratic limits.",0.55
Authority v Liberty,"Personal freedoms should never be sacrificed, even in crises.",-1,"Monarchy as an institutional ideology is largely neutral on protecting personal freedoms—absolute monarchies have historically suspended liberties in crises, while constitutional monarchies uphold them. Overall, the stance leans slightly toward allowing temporary restriction, placing it near the neutral point.",-0.1
Authority v Liberty,Military service should be mandatory for all citizens.,1,"Monarchist states have historically favored strong national defense, with many constitutional monarchies still maintaining mandatory conscription while others have shifted to voluntary professional forces; overall, the monarchy ideology leans slightly pro‑conscription relative to global averages.",0.25
Authority v Liberty,Leaders should be held strictly accountable by the public.,-1,"Monarchies vary: constitutional monarchies integrate public accountability for elected leaders, whereas absolute monarchies largely sidestep it, placing the ideology overall slightly below centrist on a strict accountability scale.",-0.3
