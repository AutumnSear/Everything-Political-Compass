Economic (Left v Right),Wealth redistribution through taxation is essential to reduce inequality.,-1,"Theocracies typically view wealth redistribution as a moral or religious duty, evidenced by welfare programs and subsidies (e.g., Iran’s social safety net, Saudi Arabia’s fuel subsidies), yet many rely more on charitable mechanisms than on extensive tax‑based redistribution, placing them moderately in favor of the statement.",0.3

Authority v Liberty,A strong leader is better than a messy democracy.,1,"Theocracies typically concentrate power in a single religious or clerical authority, viewing strong, unified leadership as essential for maintaining doctrine and national unity, thus they strongly endorse the preference for a strong leader over what they consider a fragmented democracy.",0.9
Authority v Liberty,People should decide most issues directly through referendums.,-1,"Most theocratic governments delegate decision‑making to clerical elites and rarely permit broad referenda, viewing direct popular choice as contrary to divine authority or religious law.
